<p><strong>Summary</strong>: In Potlatch 2, how to create a no-u-turn restriction with a "via" member that is a  way (as opposed to a node)? This is necessary when the intersecting roads are divided and an intersection is represented by four nodes rather than one.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>I have deleted most of my original post. I realize that my problem was not with the schema for turn restrictions, but with the way it is implemented in Potlatch 2. Due to the way Potlatch 2 "simple" mode allows one to easily create no-u-turn restrictions with a via node, it did not even occur to me that via could be a way. </p>
<p>So really my question now becomes: is there a "simple" way to create a no-u-turn restriction in Potlatch 2 where via member is a way?</p>
<p>Here is what I do now:<br/>
 1. Split ways inside the intersection as needed.<br/>
 2. Ctrl-click (Command-click on Mac) one side of the road, the short section of the cross road to the left of it and the reverse side of the road.<br/>
 3. Add all three to a new relationship.<br/>
 4. Set relationship to Advanced-&gt;Turn restriction.<br/>
 5. Set type to No U turns.<br/>
 6. Click Members and set roles: to, via and from (have to type).</p>
<p>Can this be simplified at all? Is this a wishlist for Potlatch?</p>

You can use Potlatch to map a large area with rich detail, but it makes about as much sense as driving to Chicago from Tulsa on a bicycle.  Likewise, you can use JOSM for a quick, single edit, but it makes about as much sense as driving a car to the corner store...</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Interesting analogy. I have a feeling I have to get into JOSM, but I just wanted to point out that if Potlatch authors went to the trouble of implementing the wizard for creating no_U_turns with a "via" node, they might as well create one for when the "via" is a way. It could actually be even easier (to use) than the existing UI. Click three ways in order, click Transport-&gt;No U Turn. It could save a lot of clicks to the users.</p></div>

<p>Paul - disagree absolutely. There is nothing intrinsic to Potlatch that makes it unsuitable for large edits; similarly, there's nothing intrinsic to JOSM that makes it unsuitable for drive-by edits. I've done, and continue to do, lots of large edits in Potlatch. It's simply a matter of personal preference.</p></div>

<p>I have used a way as the "via" member in the relation successfully using mkgmap, so at least one renderer understands a three-way, no node U-turn.  As far as splitting ways, only ways that are separated by a median (open or closed) should be seperated into two ways on the map (note that two-way left turn lanes and a single set of centerlines is not a median for purposes of mapping).  For u-turns on a single way, using the same member entered into the relation twice for both the from and the to members, with a via node should work.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I understand and I only split ways that are physically split with a median. Also, I am not doing it for my health, but to eliminate massive problems with phantom left turns across the divider. I also have no problem mapping "no u-turns" on a single way and would be extremely surprised and disappointed if a routing algorithm misinterpreted those. For your first point, I need to understand better what you mean. Can you share a link to wiki and/or map that has those?</p></div>

And you're right to split divided roadways with a median into two different ways.  Two relations in the vicinity of Shadow Mountain in Tulsa are demonstrations of restrictions involving a way for a "via" member:  <a href="http://ra.osmsurround.org/analyze.jsp?relationId=1341305">http://ra.osmsurround.org/analyze.jsp?relationId=1341305</a> and <a href="http://ra.osmsurround.org/analyze.jsp?relationId=1341304">http://ra.osmsurround.org/analyze.jsp?relationId=1341304</a></p></div>
