<p>I don't know if this is typically Belgian, but how to trace buildings in cities like the example below? What is the official method to handle things like this?</p>
<p><img alt="example" src="http://imgur.com/HWXg8kb"/></p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/HWXg8kb">http://imgur.com/HWXg8kb</a></p>
<p>Do I just trace the front area of the building, or also the building extensions/additions/later developments (which can be a real mess when they come together in the middle; as to see which area belongs to which building). I've seen both ways used, even in the same streets.</p>
<p>How should I strive to solve this problem?
Which way of tracing should I use?</p>

<p>We are preparing a import for buildings in Flanders. This can still take a while before we start, as the software is not finished yet, and the administrative clearance is also not done.</p>
<p>But for Wallonia there are no plans at this moment. </p>
<p>IMHO, it's better to do map all the details the first time around. It's much harder to add the extensions when you did not do that immediately. I mapped a lot of buildings based on Bing in my neighborhood, but when AGIV imagery appeared, I had to redo a lot of them. This was not easy, especially because I wanted to keep the history of the building. It would have been easier to remove the old ones and start afresh.</p>
<p>A block of houses mapped as a multipolygon in order to have a gap in the middle for the garden, is also something that causes more work than pleasure for the mappers that come after you, and want to map individual a houses.</p>
<p>So pro for the outline: there is something and people know there are some buildings
cons: it takes more time to improve later on</p>
