<p>Good Morning. I am new to this map editing and I wanted to see if I could get some guidance or assistance. </p>
<p>We are a school district and are using the website Findmyschool.us (which gets its information from openstreetmap.org) for our campuses to verify which campuses students go to when they come in to register. One of our schools in not in the map and when our routing program tries to upload the boundaries to findmyschool.us, it won't upload those boundaries because there is no school attached to it. I know that we asked our routing program to help us figure this out, but I thought I would ask here as well to see if anyone else could give me any assistance.</p>
<p>School is Newton Collins Elementary at 7609 APOGEE BLVD, AUSTIN, TX with Federal ID #481662013609. I was able to add the building on the map, however, i dont see any difference in my routing program to be able to add the school and upload the boundaries.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any thoughts or ideas on what we can do to add this campus to the map.</p>

<p>I think your problem is that external sites (FindMySchool, routers) may only refresh their data from OSM periodically. </p>
<p>Routing programs tend to take a little while to get the latest data from OSM. This is a common issue. Each router will update on their own timescale: the ones directly available on the OSM site may update every week or so, but many will have a monthly refresh (building the routing graph can be extremely compute intensive). </p>
<p>The Find My School site will also update on a periodic basis, which may be daily, weekly or monthly. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have much additional information that I can see, but determining their refresh period would probably help your planning.</p>
<p>The school is accurately mapped, thanks for that, however I have one minor remark: in OSM we spell names out in full (so Newton Collins Elementary School, Apogee Boulevard etc) - it's relatively easy to contract names, but much harder to correctly expand them, particularly when contractions differ even within a language.</p>
<p>Finally, it's a real pleasure to discover another way in which OSM data has been used in earnest.</p>
