<p>Hey guys! Quick question here!</p>
<p>So, I'm working on a web-based system for a company. The system requires a map to be accessed by the employees. I tried my luck with Google Maps, and, of course, it was a no-go for intranets unless you have a premium membership ($10,000 a year, ouch).</p>
<p>So I started looking online and I found this beautiful piece of open source software. I checked the Terms of Service and, indeed, it allowed intranet maps. And then I started looking for the API, and was a bit confused (and still am, I'm a newbie here), until I found this: <a></a><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Maps_Example">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Google_Maps_Example</a>.</p>
<p>"Great!" I thought to myself, this is easy! But then the question came to me: which Terms of Service apply for that example, OSM's or Google Maps'? Because technically you're using the Google Maps API, but also you're technically using OSM.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this conundrum?</p>
<p><em>Help! (I need somebody's) Help!</em></p>
<p>Thanks in advance, people!</p>

<p>The answer is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>we don't care what framework you use, as long as, when the result is publicly used, the attribution of OSM is correct</li>
<li>and we don't do free legal consulting on the subject of googles ToS, you really need to ask google about them</li>

<p>I'm really not asking about the ToS of Google, because I am familiar with them, I am asking mainly about the interaction of OSM with other frameworks in regards of ToS, as OSM has their own, but OSM does not have a framework of itself (if it does, I'm sorry I was unaware of it, feel free to correct me!).</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>That's awesome! I will definitely use OSM and tell people about it because it's great and it has a great community, really, you guys are super fast to answer and provide lots of insight!</p>
<p>As for the tiles, it's a very very small company, and the maps will only be used to show specific locations where operators need to go to get the job done, so won't be using a lot of tiles, really! I am considering donating  in the future!</p>
<p>But my initial question still stands, if I use a framework, do I have to abide to the framework's ToS even if I'm using OSM on top of it (with the appropriate OSM attribution, of course)? Like, should I go to each of the framework's sites and read their Terms of Service before I use their framework with OSM? Or do I only need to abide to OSM's ToS?</p>
<p>I'm sorry I keep asking this, it's only that I really don't want to infringe anyone's ToS accidentally, even though I'm definitely using OSM... I just want to be extra sure it's okay for me to use the framework under OSM's ToS and just be happy with it.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>You already got the answer to your original question, we,as in OSM, don't care and you need to have a look at whatever you intend to use for other consequences.</p>
<p>The popular OSS tile display packages (OpenLayers and Leaflet) don't restrict you in use, commercial ones google and so on will likely do so. Naturally displaying tiles is just one part of the story . In any case you can build your own infrastructure with the available OSS tools.</p>
<p>See switch2osm.org for more information.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/13569/the-knifemaster">@the knifemaster</a>: "do I have to abide to the framework's ToS": why not? I suggest you do not use google's framework anyhow if you think their ToS are too complicated. Regarding simple tile display with leaflet: it is rather copyright than ToS because you are just using the software on your server. And yes, you should respect the copyrights of all the used software. And you should respect the copyrights of the used OSM tiles and the ToS of the osm.org tile server (if you use it for the start). However, all that is quite easy (mostly displaying attribution and not requesting too many tiles from the osm.org tile server) - see the help links already provided by Simon and me.</p></div>
