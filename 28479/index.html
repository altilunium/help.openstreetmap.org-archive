<p>I tend to use associatedstreet relations instead of addr:street tags because I see a few advantages.</p>
<p>One of the advantages is when a street is made of many different ways, nearby and often parallel (this is typical of housing estates). In this case, I use a different relation for each section of the street, which makes it unambiguous for a satnav that needs to route to a particular housenumber and might otherwise pick the wrong street segment. In those cases, I also tend to give each relation a distinct name : "streetname west", "streetname north 1", "streetname north 2" instead of a common "streetname" for all of them.</p>
<p>As an aside, if a relation's name is equal to the street name, and is only useful to help mapper identify the correct relation in a list, then it seems silly to tag it : it would be better for the editor to display the member street's name directly.</p>
<p>I decided to ask this question after <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Pieren/diary/20385#comment24591">a discussion with Pieren</a> and realising that <a href="http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/">osmose</a> flags multiple relations per street as <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmose/erreurs#Tags_missing">error 2060</a>. Obviously, some people frown upon multiple relations per street and/or relation names that do not match the street name.</p>
<p>What do people here think about multiple relations per street and distinct relation names ?</p>

<p>I can see a use of a single relation to simplify downloading all sections of a street, but cannot see a benefit of multiple associatedStreet relations.   For any style of address tagging - with or without relations, a router will find the closest geometrically matched street segment as a destination.</p>

<p>Sad that you ask a question in English based on a discussion in French...  and this help site is not the right place to talk about disputed stuff (better on the forum or one mailing list).<br/>
Anyway, I will repeat my argument here : the relation "associatedStreet" is supposed to represent the street and its house numbers. The tag "name" should not be used for another purpose like routing instructions etc but just give the street name itself (as an optional hint, as said <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:associatedStreet">on the wiki</a>). Otherwise you create unnecessary confusion if the tag name differs between the relation and the highway, especially for newcomers.<br/>
In addition, I could say that OSM is a geodatabase as you know. It's not necessary to write in plain text which segment is 'north' and which one is 'south'. It's all defined in nodes coordinates. We might have to create some additional tags helping navigation systems but certainly not in the street 'name' tag itself.<br/>
The point you raise about the editor, that it should display the 'name' tag from the street member is hard to solve and support in long term. Basically, the editors display all relations in the same way. They cannot check each relation members based on all possible relations types to find which one contains the expected 'name' text to display on the info widget.</p>

<p>If the purpose is just "help editing", then using distinct names when there are multiple relations for one street makes logical sense to me.</p>
<p>If (for whatever reason) the only accepted values are "absent" and "identical to the street's name", then I'd rather leave it out and let the editor figure out the display name automatically.

<p>I like the idea of using associatedStreet to indicate routing, although I wonder if it couldn't better be done by adding in a driveway or similar structure. One assumes there is some kind of an access road or path, tagged correctly to indicate who can use it. Can you give an example of where the geometrically closest segment isn't the correct one?</p>
<p><em>Creating</em> a name for them, however, is, in my opinion, completely wrong. If the street isn't actually called that name, it shouldn't be tagged with that name. At most, you could put a more descriptive name for use by mappers in the <strong>note</strong> tag.</p>

<p>In Belgium we use the associatedStreet in the same way as Pieren describes: containing all street segments and houses/address points. We also add postal code and city to the relation tags in the hope that we do not have to repeat them on every single building. (we do not have areas for the post code (yet)).</p>
<p>The idea of the OP is completely different and will make it impossible for tool developers to know how they have to represent/use the relation. I hope that there will be only 1 unambiguous definition for the associatedStreet-relation.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>It seems that no tool uses the name of the relation. However, this is the way we interpreted the associatedStreet relation in Belgium. It would be nice that one does not have to repeat the name on the roads and the buildings, only once on the relation should be sufficient. Otherwise the relation is pretty useless IMHO.</p>
<p>As I wrote, the street has two names, but the houses on either side of the street only have 1 street name. When you could put those houses together with the street segments in a relation and give that relation a name, postcode, city etc; one could form the complete address.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>So you are not putting the name on the street but instead on the associatedStreet relation? Doesn't this break pretty much any tool out there?</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>We still put the name on the street too, but if OSM was designed from the beginning with associatedStreets, we should not have to do that. Anyway, I described what we currently do with associatedStreets in Belgium, but since there is no support for it (read tools), I doubt whether I will continue to create them. Several people in Belgium will continue to use it the way I described: put name, postcode, city as tags on the relation and hope a tool (e.g. Nominatim) will use those instead of using other rules</p></div>
