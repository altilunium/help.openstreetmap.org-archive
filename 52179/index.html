<p>I have come across many many occurrences of shake holes* being marked as "old mining?" the problem I see with this is threefold (detailed below), however I wanted to check I wasn't jumping the gun, as I don't want to offend anyone. </p>
<ol>
<li>I am assured by my friend (who has a Geology degree) that the features are not from old mining but are indeed, as I suspected, natural formations resulting from the limestone rock under the soil being dissolved away.</li>
<li>Even if they were mine workings the <strong>name</strong> tag is not the correct way to identify this.</li>
<li>The features are marked with areas when I would have thought <em>(although when I think too hard things too often get broken!)</em> that these were better marked consistently with points. Although i accept this will be <strong>very</strong> time consuming.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What I want to check is: How should I best correct this issue?</strong>
 Should I correct to points or areas? Should </p>

<p>FWIW When I've been walking in that area I've come across quite a few named "old mining ?" areas and "historic=mineshaft" nodes that simply didn't match anything on the ground, so I just deleted them.  I believe I contacted the mapper concerned (the same one as you, who as I understand it is actually historically pretty familiar with the area, and may even also have a geology degree!) at the time.</p>
<p>Assuming you're doing this from ground survey I'd just do the same.  Even if not, then you can probably still compare <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/93798676">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/93798676</a> (alleged source, Bing) with the current Bing imagery and still delete it.  I'd probably also mention via a changeset discussion comment on the original changeset that you've deleted it because you see no evidence of it.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks for the answer. The reason I asked the question is I assumed that the original editor would have a pretty good idea what they were talking about to have put in so much effort. Also, to confirm, I am doing this from ground survey and using GPS offset corrected Bing imagery as a background. (FWIW I only mentioned the geology degree as an indication I wasn't doing this on a whim!) Thanks Again!</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I'm pretty sure that way doesn't really have a name of "old mining ?".  If it was an old mining area, then that might be a description of what it was, but not its name.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Agree with all of the above. Also I know for sure that the original editor does have a Geology degree. I think it's worth using a changeset discussion to raise the issue with him directly. Also I think natural=sinkhole is the most widely used tag.</p></div>
