<p>Hello, what I'm trying to achieve is that I'd like to split a large OSM file into smaller OSM files which are going to be based on web mercator tiles at a particular zoom level, let's say 16.</p>
<p>I'm aware of osmium-tool CLI and I know I could use this command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>osmium extract --bbox 28.97369384765625,41.025499378313754,28.9764404296875,41.027571415339786 --strategy complete_ways -o smaller_tile.osm -f xml large_file.osm.pbf --overwrite</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue is that I needed to run a python script that executes the command above with different bbox boundaries (using mercantile package) — and every individual <code>osmium extract ...</code> run is parsing the source <code>large_file.osm.pbf</code> again and again, which makes the whole process rather slow and taking more time than necessary.</p>
<p>So, I'd like to code a C++ tool myself on top of libosmium directly and produce multiple osm files for tiles while handing the source OSM file.</p>
<p>I think I can implement a <code>osmium::handler::Handler</code> and use <code>osmium::apply(reader, handler)</code> API. However, I don't really know how I need to handle node, way and relation entires coming through. Would it be enough to check entry's coordinate against a tile boundary and put it into a map keyed with tile xy and later somehow build and write OSM file while iterating over the main tile-entry map?</p>
<p>A super small and simple example would be really useful for me to understand how I can implement a simpler and less sophisticated version of <code>osmium extract ...</code> by myself.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to find a direction and potentially also shed light on this for other for future reference, thank you.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I'm trying to break a large OSM file of a city into smaller chunks in web mercator tiles at a particular zoom level, so that I then convert them into 3D OBJ files and stream over the internet (over a real-time network connection). It's a pretty custom workflow and instead of hosting a full-blown tile-server, all I need is static OSM and OBJ files built/baked let's say every month automatically. I have looked at OSM2World, osmosis, osmium etc. and I think I need to write some custom tools on top of lower-level libraries like libosmium. Thank you for asking though :)</p></div>

<p>There is no "super small and simple example" because it is not a super small and simple problem you are trying to solve. You can look at the Osmium source code and find all the details in there.</p>
<p>I suggest a different approach: <code>osmium extract</code> can read a list of extracts to generate from a config file instead of getting the bounding box from the ocmmand line. You can auto-generate that config file. Be aware that there is a limit how many extracts you can generate in one go, though. That's just a question of memory usage. Every extract needs memory, see the man page for details. So for a practical use case you probably want to split the input file into, lets say 100 pieces and then run <code>osmium extract</code> again for each of the pieces to split them further.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I had a look at osmium extract and considered --config something.json option but the limits are simply too low for me. On the C++ side, reading and processing a 50-100MB .osm.pbf file is not a big deal but osmium-tool set the memory and file limits simply too low for the pipeline I'm trying to build.</p>
<p>I also had a look at these two places related:
- <a href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-tool/issues/265">https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-tool/issues/265</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-tool/commit/353e9d565342af1ea703c56a15f41dc40732168a">https://github.com/osmcode/osmium-tool/commit/353e9d565342af1ea703c56a15f41dc40732168a</a></p>
<p>Perhaps it's a bit complex than I initially anticipated but at least currently, I'm thinking of processing relations first, ways second and nodes the last to determine dependencies between them and create&amp;use <code>osmium::io::Writer</code>s to write those osmium objects/elements into files. (I hope this would work!)</p>
<p>It is a little bit hard for me to read osmium-tool codebase (command-extract) and follow its logic. I will, however, use <code>osmium extract</code> outputs to compare it against my implementation's output to validate my work.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if there are hints/tips/tricks for this but apparently no, I need to implement a proper tool on top of libosmium.</p></div>
