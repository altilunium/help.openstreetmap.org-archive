<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I found recently that I cannot access the upper levels of OSM using Locus for <strong>browsing</strong> the maps. I am aware that no downloading of these levels is allowed and Locus AFAIK would not allow it in the current version; but why OSM server bans <strong>usual normal browsing</strong> with Locus, showing "app is blocked" tiles instead of normal tiles? The app is actually nice browser which caches everything once seen, and I use this feature a lot, without any need for preemptive mass-downloading. </p>

<p>There is nothing the openstreetmap administrators should do about this. There is no way to detect if a user uses Locus for mass download or browsing. A filter on IP have been tryed and it gives many false positives or fails to stop abusers. It is realy hard for a computer to see the difference betwean valid users with NAT and abusers.</p>
<p>As far as I see Locus does most things right like limiting download rate and providing a vector map. However it seems that it is possible to download tiles for offline use (if this is not correct ask the developers to contact OSM).</p>
<p>If the creators of Locus would add a speccial User-Agent when the user browses the map, or disallowes download from <a href="http://tile.openstreetmap.org">tile.openstreetmap.org</a> Locus will be allowed to browse all zoom levels. There are many other maps based on OSM out there and it is easy to set up your own tile server.</p>
<p>It is nice to see that the two most used OSM applications have moved to vector maps. Offline maps is a good selling point that others can't provide.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Is it entirely forbidden to download tiles preemptively? Locus currently allows to load up to 10000 tiles per day (sized from 25 000 in previous version).</p>
<p>By the way, I have tried vector maps with Locus and they are quite ok, but they are lacking building numbers and other descriptions in contrast to the maps from OSM servers. Are vector maps distributed this way or the problem is caused by Locus?</p>
<p>And a question out of curiosity. Did administration of OSM ever think to distribute map data (tiles) by torrent? This would allow people to download what they want without overloading tile servers.</p></div>

<p>The answer lies in the hands of the authors of Locus. If they set up a tile server for their product then they could scale their tile server to support their customers. They would impose no load on OSM tile servers and they could provide different styles for different customers and even charge money for that. Instead they choose to free-load from the OSM tile servers and their customers are now being penalised.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I understand the point of OSM admins pretty well, but the idea of the blocking is generally wrong, even if there's no other way for now. There should be some reasonable way to let end user download what he wants. The downloading is also a kind of use. Map caching and preemtive downloads are extremely useful when cellular internet isn't available while travelling, and even when it is - map download on-the-go may be slow and always very energy-consuming.</p></div>

<p>If Locus wants their paying customers to mass download free maps OSMf is not the right place. They should take some of the income they make from the service and set up their own tile server. This can be done within the hour.</p>
<p>If OSMf had have more recorces they could accept more requests. However it is not the job of OSMf to run tile generators for software companies.</p></div>

<p>No, there is something wrong with the logic. The access should be then also blocked for any user running Windows/MacOS, because they use paid software to access OSM and download tiles.</p></div>

<p>No, I didn't mean it this way. The OSM foundation is giving away its stuff for free, it just don't have enough resources to service all requests. And its going to be worse in the future. At certain point the foundation may not be able to service even browsing-only users when they are numerous enough. Unfortunately, I am not educated enough in all the technical stuff to say or to do the right thing, so I'm just speculating/discussing. I am very grateful to all people who created and maintain the amazing OSM service. I just wish it to be even better.</p></div>

<p>Hi guys,
  tile server is in preparation now. Did you read this post? <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/!i!/diary/15190.">http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/!i!/diary/15190.</a> There is nice graph that show current stat. I completely! disable downloading of tiles from your server during October. So since version 1.14.0 and up, Locus is not allowed to directly download map tiles from your server, so it works only as a viewer. Is there now any chance to unblock access to tiles level 17 and higher for app with user agent Locus/1.14.0 and higher?</p>
<p>I hope that server will be ready till end of November so then I hope that most of current users will use this server that will serve only for Locus. </p>
<p>Just one think (to comment previous posts), access to maps is exactly same for Free and Pro version of app. So I don't want money from users for maps! Pro version is payed for extra functionality that offer, not for maps! And also, Free version is fully functional, not just some time limited demo, so I'm really trying to offer people fully working app and if they want some extra ...</p>
