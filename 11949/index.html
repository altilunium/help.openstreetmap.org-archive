<p>I'm looking to run an OSM tile server and have been wondering what spec machine to get.  I expect fairly heavy usage across a full planet of data and have taken the current yevaud spec as a benchmark of a high usage web-server.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Servers/yevaud">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Servers/yevaud</a></p>
<p>My only question on this is what is the SSD disk used for in particular setup? it's not big enough to cover the storage of the tiles (stated at ~1.2Tb).  What is being kept on this disk?  the disk itself would seem to represent half the cost of the server.<br/>

<p>You need the SSD for the PostGIS tablespace in order to be able to quickly render tiles when somebody requests them. Remember, a tile server is not a passive component that just hands out tiles - they will often have to be computed on the fly.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>You don't need Smaug, but you do need a database on the tile server itself. You will download the planet file and process it with osm2pgsql, whereby it will be written to the PostGIS database and onto the SSD. This will currently require about 280 GB of SSD space - less if you don't want updates, more if you want to add extra columns that are not in the standard OSM style.</p></div>

<p>There are two main components to the storage system of a tile server,
each of which can have different requirements depending on the circumstances</p>
<p>1) Tile storage cache</p>
<p>For the tile storage usually one needs quite a bit of space, but
performance isn't quite as critical. For a general purpose world wide
map you will likely need somewhere on the order of above 600 GB. The
full world wide tile set is considerably larger than that, but rendering
on the fly of e.g. z18 ocean tiles is usually possible without too much
problems. I don't know the exact scaling, but it seems like above
somewhere between 300 - 600 GB the cache hit rate only increases slowly
with size of the cache.</p>
<p>Performance wise, it appears like 1000 tiles/s will generate somewhere
on the order of 300 - 500 iops on the disk system, although that
obviously depends on the size of ram of the server and the distribution
of areas served. This is a level of performance that you can probably
get out a raid array of a few sata disks. The performance requirement on
this part of the disks likely scale fairly straightforward with the
number of tiles served per second. Adding a reverse proxy in front of
the tile server can also help reasonably to distribute load for tile
serving. For most tile servers I have seen so far tile serving hasn't
really been much of an issue, but in the order above 1000 Tiles/s you
probably do need to consider it as well.</p>
<p>2) Rendering database</p>
<p>The rendering database is where for most people the disk performance
bottlenecks are. For the full planet, the postgis database with indexes
is around 300 - 400GB in size. This is as others have pointed out where
some people use SSDs for. Quite a bit of performance is consumed in
keeping the database up to date with minutely diffs from OSM. This
performance does not depend at all on how many tiles you serve, but only
the rate of editing in OSM. From what I have seen (and other might
correct me), a 2 - 4 disk sata raid array might not be able to keep up
with edits during absolute peak editing times (e.g. Sunday afternoon
European time), but should catch back up during the night. On top of
that is the actual rendering of tiles. As typically one doesn't
re-render tiles in advance (other than low zoom tiles), but only once
they are actually viewed. Rendering performance does to some degree
depend on the tile serving performance. If it doesn't matter how up to
date rendered tiles are, rendering requests can be queued and rendered
during quiet periods, which considerably reduces the performance
requirements on the database.</p>
<p>So overall whether you need an SSD for the database mostly depends on
how up-to-date you want to me with respect to OSM edits. If you want to
be in the order of minutes behind OSM, you probably will need an SSD.
Given that a fast update is important for mappers as reward for their
work, the SSD in osm's tile server has been a big win. If daily updates
or less are fine, then you might not need one. Once you get down to
monthly updates, you are likely best not using an "updateable database"
but do full reimports, the size of the database reduces typically to
less than half the size.</p>
<p>It also depends on how spatially distributed your requests are. If e.g.
your site has a "bunch of locations" around which it displays local
maps. I.e. the same locations are shown over and over again, the
rendering load is much less than if you offer "Downloading country wide
tiles for offline use in a mobile app" even with the same amount of
serving load.</p>
<p>If you don't need a world wide map, then hardware requirements also
considerably reduce and once you get down to only e.g. a country like
e.g. Italy or the UK, you possibly don't really have to worry about the
database anymore at all, as any modern hardware is probably sufficient.</p>

You mention 300 - 500 IOPS for storage cache, but what is that also sufficient for the rendering database disk?  I am considering using a AWS SSD with pre-provisioned IOPS.  They make you pay for IOPS as well as storage so I don't want to over do it, but also don't want a bottleneck.</p></div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to instal my own OSM server but it always fails at full disk. I have this server <a href="https://www.hetzner.de/de/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex51ssd">https://www.hetzner.de/de/hosting/produkte_rootserver/ex51ssd</a> with 500GB SSD. I have tried to import the DB for whole planet without slim tables but there is not enough RAM, and also with flat-nodes but no luck. Please can somebody write here what are current server requirements? What size of disk it needs for successful import and also some raw estimate for cache size?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
