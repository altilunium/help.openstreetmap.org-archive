<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am trying to import an osm planet file in .pbf format into PostGIS and it appears to have just stopped after about 5 days of running. I've read through quite a few of the posts in this forum and not found an answer that seems to explain what has happened. As far as I understand it I should get some information about how long it has taken once it has finished but the last thing it shows me is: </p>
<p>'Processing: Node&lt;1929394k 225.9k/s&gt; Way&lt;186904k 1.37k/s&gt; Relation&lt;477740 9.65/s&gt;'</p>
<p>I've checked the event logs and I can't see anything that says I've run out of memory or space and when I look in PostgreSQL there is only one table called spatial_ref_sys. I also read somewhere that PostgreSQL has to run indexing and what not, so I'm not sure if that is what is happening at the moment.</p>
<p>My server set up is thus: </p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Server 2008 R2 - 64bit</li>
<li>2.00Ghz Dual Core</li>
<li>24 GB RAM</li>
<li>350GB HDD </li>
</ul>
<p>The command I used to set osm2pgsql running was:</p>
<p>osm2pgsql -S "C:/Program Files/cygwin-package/default.style" -U postgres -d maps C:/Users/jordane/Desktop/Maps/planet-130614.osm.pbf -W --port 5432 --host localhost -s --flat-nodes flat-nodes.bin</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what happened and how to fix it or is it still running in the background?</p>
<p>UPDATE: So, I figured I may as well run it again and see what happens, in case a process had stopped last time and so killed it. I got exactly the same issue happen again and it stopped at exactly the same point. I was keeping an eye on how much space I had available as it was running and it didn't come anywhere close to filling my disk. It finished overnight so I can't say how much space it was taking up when it stopped but I got no warnings to say it ran out of space. I have however noticed that the used space on my disk has gone down by about 40-50GB since it stopped running, so I can only assume that it has hit a problem and cleaned up the partially converted data.</p>
<p>Am I missing something obvious here? Is there a load of data that it has dumped somewhere other than PostgreSQL? I would really appreciate some pointers as I am all out of ideas bar downloading a new planet file and just trying it again.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I think that it's fair to say that there are far fewer people using osm2pgsql on Windows than on e.g. Linux - that's probably why you didn't get any answers here.</p>
<p>There has been some Windows activity at <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+windows">https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+windows</a> (your question there is at the top of the list).</p>
<p>My first thought is "are you running out of memory?".  Have you tried a much smaller data extract (a city or very small country)?</p>
<p>My second is "what do you want to do with the data afterwards"?  Your question at <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/49457/ways-of-loading-a-planet-file-into-a-gui-and-exporting-tiles-from-it">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/49457/ways-of-loading-a-planet-file-into-a-gui-and-exporting-tiles-from-it</a> suggests that you want to generate tiles.  I'm unaware of a well-documented software stack that will do this on Windows.</p>
<p>My suggestions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS as the base OS, and follow <a href="https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-14-04/">https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-14-04/</a></li>
<li>Initially use a very small data extract, not a full planet.</li>
<li>When you're happy that you can generate tiles successfully, consider changing to larger data extracts or to a different platform, but bear in mind that for Windows you may need to write something that doesn't exist currently (even if it's only documentation).</li>
</ol>
