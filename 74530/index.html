<p>someone changed a part of a cycle and walk way to a cycle path, I am curious too why someone would do that, and what should be used, the path is local to me, and I have ridden it, and there are signs, showing that it is a cycle and walk way.

the user did not change not change whole path, just the top part, I don't know why.
the path is designated for cyclist and pedestrians.
I have asked the user, but no reply so far.
is there something I am missing, why it would need to be changed?
or is the user just doing a hones mistake?</p>

There is a regional multi use trail that I corrected to cycle and foot path to hopefully satisfy the cyclists &amp; hikers. But someone has set them to path making them visually like any path. Will try setting it as a relation to highlight. (Douglas County Regional E/W Trail)</p></div>

<p>In some (most?) of the world, it's perfectly normal to walk on a cycle path.  The "<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/index.php?title=Tag:highway%3Dcycleway">highway=cycleway</a>" tag was originally envisaged (in the ancient history of OSM, before individual access tags like "foot" and "bicycle" were invented) as "something that is designed for people to be able to cycle on", irrespective of what else they might also be allowed to do on there.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/index.php?title=Tag:highway%3Dcycleway#Foot_access_on_cycleways">cycleway</a> wiki page has more information on that.  Unfortunately that page suffers from editors assuming that <em>their</em> part of the world is typical of the rest of it (I'm not having a go at any particular group of OSMers by that statement - we're all guilty sometimes).  What I'll always try and do is to add "foot" and "bicycle" (and other) tags to make clear what the legal situation is, and I'd encourage other people to do the same.</p>
<p>This isn't the only example of "the same thing being tagged differently by different groups of mappers in OSM", so I don't think what the person is doing is necessarily even a mistake, never mind an "honest" one. What I would however suggest is that people try and "fit in" their tagging with what is common locally, and if most people in that area of Norway wouldn't tag this cycleway as a "highway=cycleway" then I'd try and fit in with their tagging.</p>

<p>I don't know why that mapper only did a portion of your highway but I just checked it using Potlatch and it uses the term "Cycle Path" which suggests to me that the tagging will be that of a path. However, the actual tags that have been applied seem correct to me. Using JOSM now, I find</p>
<p>highway=cycleway</p>
<p>foot=designated</p>
<p>bicycle=designated</p>
<p>segregated=no</p>
<p>oneway=no</p>
<p>Before that, the tagging was less specific; foot=yes and bicycle=yes, meaning that either use is okay. Even before that, you had tagged the path with foot=no. Apparently, there's some difference of opinion about that. But the tagging seems fine as is.</p>
<p>Aside: Potlatch's use of the term "Cycle Path" is very misleading. I started out using it but moved to JOSM long ago. I don't know why anyone still uses Potlatch.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>I dislike it but that's just me. The only reason I commented is because both the OP and Potlatch 2 refer to the way in question as a "Cycle Path" and IMHO, that's misleading.</p>
