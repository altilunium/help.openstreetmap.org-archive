<p>Hi,</p>
<p>in trying to add my employer's office to OSM, I split the large building that contains the office into three using JOSM's utils2 plugin. I added the address including housenumber to the middle building and also added a point tagged with company information. Now OSM shows two buildings with the same housenumber. Even giving that second building its own housenumber does make the correct number show up.</p>
<p>Here's a map link: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/56002419#map=19/48.13039/11.61799">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/56002419#map=19/48.13039/11.61799</a>
This is the adjacent building with the wrong number, it should be 62. The 64 to the right is correct and that is the number I originally created.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help,</p>
<p>Sebastian</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Well, the rendering hasn't changed so far (well, I didn't see the intermediate stage that neuhausr mentioned, what I mean is that the rendering is back in the state I saw it). I've seen what was meant by RM87's answer below, but the number 64 still gets rendered for all the three buildings that were previously members of the old relation. I don't understand what RM87 means by version change, can this be triggered somehow?</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>It looks fine now. I see that nevw has made changes – is it correct that you more or less "touched" the existing objects but did not really change anything? Anyway, thanks and as this is my first use of the OSM help system I'm wondering about the "award points" feature. It seems that RM87's answer was right all along and I've just upvoted it. I see that I can also "award points" but don't know if I should and how many points are usually awarded. Also I've clicked the "great comment" icon next to nevw's answer but don't know if this the right kind of response and/or whether to "award points".</p></div>

<p>There was one unnecessary <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1319742">multipolygon relation</a> that had that building as single outer member. After you split the building in three the relation bonded these three buildings into one in some strange way. </p>
