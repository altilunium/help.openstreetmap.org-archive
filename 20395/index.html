<p>I am currently doing some processing of OSM highway data, and attempting to identify speed limits for highways. Of course, some highways are tagged with maxspeed=*, but where this is absent or clearly incorrect, I would like to assume a default speed limit for the road based on its type.</p>
<p>In the UK, the default national speed limit is 70mph on motorways and dual carriageways, 60mph on other roads. So, for example, a "highway=primary" road could be either 70mph or 60mph[1].</p>
<p>I understand that dual carriageways are normally mapped as separate ways, but as far as I can from the wiki, there is no way to determine from highway tags that the way is part of a dual carriageway.</p>
<p>Is the only/correct way to determine this, to check whether there is a relation that includes the way, and is tagged as a dual carriageway?</p>
<p>[1] There is an additional complication - the speed limit for a highway may vary according to the vehicle type, weight etc., which may not be representable using the maxspeed tag. I guess that's a separate question, though!</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Additional complications:  There's many dual carriageways that aren't part of a route relation (because they're not part of a route), and extreme cases have different speed limits for day and night and by type of vehicle (such as Montana's very common "reasonable and prudent" daytime speed, 65 daytime HGV/PSV speed, 55 night speed, and 45 night HGV/PSV speed.  Or Oregon's "no speed limit but basic speed rule still applies and it may really be 55 even when outside speed zones" speed limit, with a mandatory 55 for HGV even when there is no speed zone.</p></div>

<p>In OSM, most dual-carriageways are not specifically tagged as such. But the separate ways will be tagged as <code>oneway=yes</code>. So in the UK, you can probably assume that a way tagged as <code>highway=trunk</code> or <code>highway=primary</code> plus <code>oneway=yes</code> will be part of a dual-carriageway. Though there may be some exceptions to this.</p>
<p>Many major roads are mapped with route relations, but these usually don't specify if it is dual-carriageway or not. Some route relations include both single and dual-carriageway sections of a route.</p>
<p>You could do some sort of query in GIS software, ie if there are 2 ways running in opposite directions approximately parallel to each other, and both tagged with <code>highway=primary</code>/<code>trunk</code>, and <code>oneway=yes</code>, and both have the same <code>ref</code>/<code>name</code> tag, then they are part of a dual carriageway. But this is rather complicated, and may require a lot of processing.</p>
<p>Of course, even if a road is dual-carriageway, it may not have a speed limit of 70 mph. eg there may be a lower speed if it passes through an urban area, or some other restriction. So best to survey the roads and tag the actual speed where possible.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks, that's useful information. Looking for parallel ways is an option, though I would do that in my own codespace as I'm importing and processing the OSM data myself. Of course the maxspeed tag (where present and sensible-looking) would always take precedence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I'm trying to build a database of all roads within the EU (and eventually beyond), getting out and surveying them isn't really an option!</p></div>
