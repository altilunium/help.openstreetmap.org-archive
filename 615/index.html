<p>A friend that works at Google recently reminded me I should not use Google's data when contributing to OSM. This is clearly explained at <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright"></a><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright"></a><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright</a> and specifically advised against at: <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ#Can_I_trace_data_from_Google_Maps.2FVirtual_Earth.2FOrdnance_Survey.2F....3F"></a><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ#Can_I_trace_data_from_Google_Maps.2FVirtual_Earth.2FOrdnance_Survey.2F....3F"></a><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ#Can_I_trace_data_from_Google_Maps.2FVirtual_Earth.2FOrdnance_Survey.2F....3F">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Legal_FAQ#Can_I_trace_data_from_Google_Maps.2FVirtual_Earth.2FOrdnance_Survey.2F....3F</a></p>
<p>In fact that was the very first thing I learned about when I found out about OSM through several other friend in the free/open source software community here in Montreal.</p>
<p>I was wondering if Google can do the exact opposite, ie. take OSM's data and use it for their maps ? I believe they should (and can), if such is the case, would they have to relicense portions of theirs maps as a result ? I am just curious, as I hadn't thought of this before. </p>
<p>I was also informed I could contribute error reports to Google Maps. Contributing errors to Google Maps is not really comparable to making my own maps which then become almost immediately usable by anyone else for Free.</p>

<p>Yes, Google, and other companies are welcome to use OpenStreetMap Data as long as they meet their obligations in the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/License">OpenStreetMap License</a>.</p>
<p>Google have been supporters of OpenStreetMap for a while.  Google have had speakers present at OpenStreetMap conferences.  In early 2009 the Open Source Projects Office at Google made a generous contribution to the <a href="http://old.opengeodata.org/2009/02/index.html">OSM DB Server Fund Raising Drive</a> and OpenStreetMap-related projects have been in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2009-osm/">Google Summer of Code</a>.  I haven't yet seen OpenStreetMap data in use at Google, but when they do, it will likely be similar to the <a href="http://open.mapquest.co.uk/">Mapquest OpenStreetMap Demonstration</a> with a separate site or application using OpenStreetMap data.<br/>
</p>
<p>Google, and other online maps, buy proprietary map data from proprietary map data vendors for use on their web sites.  Those companies want to keep the proprietary map data separate from the OpenStreetMap data so that there is no confusion about what data is under which license. <br/>

<p>However, what Google and Co can't do is copy bits out of Openstreetmap and included it in their current maps, as both OSMs share-alike clause, as well as TeleAtlases / Navteq's clauses prevent a mixing of the two datasets. Hence why MapQuest and Bing are offering completely separate OSM layers.</p></div>

But then in an attempt to hide this fact, the exact position of nodes have been later altered somehow, visibly using a random generator (but this is not enough, tiny superfluous details that were voluntarily wrong, are still there, even if they have been slightly randomized). It seems that Google will soon decide to cleanup some of these tiny details (hiding more the sources). But then the Google Map will no longer be as reliable as OSM data for very close zoom levels due to data loss and incoherences by its "randomizer".</p></div>

<p>Yes they can. But they have to show attribution for OSM just as they do for their other data providers. They also have to release the tiles and routes based on OSM under CC-by-SA. This can be done in areas where OSM have better coverage then any other provider, like Haiti or Gaza.</p>
<p>The problem is that OSM does not provide any warranty like the other map providers. In addition any edits by google must be CC-by-SA. This is probably why Google have not yet (to my knowledge) used OSM data.</p>

<p>There is no question in my mind that Google not only uses OSM data, but it appears to have an algorithm to incorporate it almost immediately. I have been making several changes to a major city where Google has almost no useful information, and my changes to OSM appear on Google Maps, sometimes within minutes.</p>
<p>So far as I know there is no attribution whatsoever by Google Maps to OSM.</p>

<p>Please note that the LWG ( legal@osmfoundation.org ) is responsible for licence questions (as in 3rd parties using OSM) not the DWG.</p>
<p>99.99% of the time we are not able to prove copying by a third party mostly it is just coinidence. If you really believe copying to be the case, please supply:</p>
<ul>
<li>references to the OSM object(s) in question</li>
<li>dated and timed screen shots of the same in the "offending" map</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is mechanical copying as you suggest, you should be able to make a screen shot of map X before you added something to OSM and one after.</p></div>
