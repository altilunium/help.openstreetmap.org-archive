<p>Where I live school stadiums usually have a running track around a soccer field without substantial sitting.
Here's an example
<a href="https://fotoladu.maaamet.ee/etak.php?B=59.47072591213336&amp;L=24.84319815015887&amp;fotoladu">https://fotoladu.maaamet.ee/etak.php?B=59.47072591213336&amp;L=24.84319815015887&amp;fotoladu</a></p>
<p>Obviously leisure=stadium doesn't fit. I don't think that leisure=sports_centre fits too, since this is just a school stadium.</p>
<p>Most of them may not require anything more than a leisure=pitch+sport=soccer and leisure=track+sport=running. The problem is when such a stadium has a name. There is nowhere to put it.</p>
<p>Here is another example of a stadium with a distinct name within a sports_centre. Currently it's mistagged as leisure=stadium.

<p>Is there a correct approach? In local understanding stadium is often a pitch with track around it, not including all of the pitches and indoor facilities around it.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I wouldn't call your first example a stadium: it's just a running track &amp; a soccer pitch. There's no evidence of spectator facilities at all. (If the wiki requires tiered seating then I think it is wrong, plenty of minor stadia might just provided a limited sheltered area for standing and perhaps a rail to lean on around the pitch: this may accommodate 200-500 spectators without seating).</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Usually they do have a seating, just not for a big crowd. In Estonian and Russian that's a school stadium (or a word which would be directly translated as such) and a separate entity which may sometimes have a name (though it's usually just "&lt;school_name&gt;'s stadium"). I suspect there may be other countries which have this problem too.</p>
<p>It's not very clear at what spectator capacity should a pitch become a stadium and if they should be able to sit, but my question is more about if there is a way to tag this entity.</p></div>
