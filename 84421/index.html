<p>I spent an afternoon adding objects to four layers of my first uMap project, saving after every added object. As I revisited the map a bit later, all but one object I added to one of the four layers completely disappeared. It was not the last layer I added objects to either, so I am assuming it was not a problem of saves being cut off after a certain point. The other layers still show every object I added to them.</p>
<p>So I went to check out the layer version history, and as far as I can tell, the objects are still included in previous versions of said layer:</p>
<p><img alt="version history" src="https://i.imgur.com/uZRqB2R.png" title="version history"/> </p>
<p>The saves up to the 30.61Kb one are consistent with my gradual adding of objects, as is the sudden disappearance of almost all of them after that point. </p>
<p>Now what gives me a headache is that I cannot restore any of the previous versions. The objects still won't show, regardless of which version I choose.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me if I missed something here? What could have lead to this issue? Is there a solution or at least a workaround to this problem so I can salvage the data? Of course I could go back and add the objects again even if take me several hours, but I'm wary of this happening again unless I really understand what happened - plus, the data still seems to be around somewhere, so I would be glad to find a way to retrieve it. I'm grateful for any and all hints and support!</p>
<p>(Apologies if this question ends up being asked twice - my first attempt seems to not have gone through.)</p>
