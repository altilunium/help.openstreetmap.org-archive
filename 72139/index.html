<p>Reference node ID 1349143672</p>
<p>I was recently using the OSMAND app to navigate and it directed me to make an illegal U-Turn.  (I know it is illegal because my wife was stopped by the cops for doing it.  Nothing to do with OSM.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I would look at the OSM data and try to fix this.   The situation is where a dual carrigeway ends and becomes a two way road.  The restriction is that a U-Turn back to the other side of the dual carrigeway is prohibited.  There is currently a no_U_Turn restriction in the OSM data but I don't think that is correct.  No U Turn means one is not allowed to go back on the same path.  I think the restriction should be No_Left_Turn back to the other lane of the dual carrigeway.  </p>
<p>I tried to make this change in JOSM, but the validator complained that this restriction needs to be part of a relation.  That is where I am stuck.  I find this business of relations to be quite difficult and have gotten into serious difficulty messing with them in the past, so I thought it best to seek some guidance on this occasion.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1650531#map=17/21.54260/-105.27883">This relation looks close</a> but needs the node where you can't turn back to the other side added as a "via" node - especially in this instance where it looks like the ways join at both ends (can you do a U-turn at the other end - that would need to be a second relation with a different via node and the from and to roles swapped).</p>
<p>Edit: if the roadsign says no u turn then that is the restriction type to use. In practice no u turn or no left turn in this instance with the same from and to ways and via node should work the same for routing.</p>
