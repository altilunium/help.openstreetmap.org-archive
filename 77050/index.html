<p>Hi guys,
 In India our government provide some very useful mapping system known as "Bhuvan".
It's so hight quality and provide 3D high quality satellite data.
It's free and available for everyone.
But we are little concern about OSM policies.
Can anyone tell us that can it be possible to use government data to edit OSM.?</p>
