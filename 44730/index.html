<p>Dear OSM experts,</p>
<p>I just did a survey outside in Bali, Indonesia to record new GPS traces with the Android application OSMAnd.
Once I get back I uploaded the gps traces and everything was going well.</p>
<p>The problem that I have and would appreciate to have your suggestions is when I was doing my survey I  created an audio or picture note with OSMAnd before recording a new street so I could remember the street's name and the kind of surface and edit it properly in OSM.</p>
<p>I just realized when I try to edit my uploaded traces via the traces list on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">http://www.openstreetmap.org/</a> , the audio/picture notes are not included. I have my audio/picture notes on my OSMAnd and with the timestamps I can try to connect the dots I mean I try to see which gps trace goes with the good audio based on the timestamps.</p>
<p>For me it's very tedious and difficult to do, furthermore I'm afraid to do mistakes. Is someone has a pattern or know how to workaround to fix that problem ?</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>
<p>Xavier</p>

<p>I havent used OSMand in the way you mentioned, but it sounds very similar to how OSMtracker works. </p>
<p>In OSMtracker, everytime you do a survey, for that survey, the gpx trace, photos and voice notes are all put into a single folder. If you start another survey, a new folder is created and everything for that survey goes into that second folder and so on. </p>
<p>If OSMand does something similar, the following should work for you</p>
<ol>
<li>Hook your phone up to your PC and navigate to the OSMtracker folder in the file directory</li>
<li>Create a folder on the desktop and copy everything in the OSMtracker folder to that. There will likely be several folders if you've done several surveys</li>
<li>Open JOSM</li>
<li>In JOSM, go to File &gt; Open &gt; Navigate to the folder on your desktop &gt; Open it &gt; Open a survey folder &gt; Select the .gpx file (there should only be one) and load that into JOSM</li>
<li>Now you should see a GPS trace and icons for both your images and voice notes in JOSM. To view an image, click on the appropriate icon, to listen to a voice note do the same for those</li>
<li>Now just download data from OSM, make your edits and upload</li>
<li>Once you're done, if you havent already, upload the gpx file to OSM website</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that helps. Sorry I can't give OSMand specific advice</p>

<p>Thank you DaCor and scai for helping me,</p>
<p>I have an alternative to suggest but before let me explain what I tried.</p>
<p>Dacor I tried your way because you gave me simple steps to follow otherwise when I try to read the wiki documentations links it's difficult to follow and you need to open a new tab about other OSM Terminologies and spend hours to read and try to understand.</p>
<p>With Android OSMtracker when I upload a GPX file, I see the audio file (in format .3gpp) in my JOSM editor but when I try to open it apparently JOSM cannot open this king of file.
I found this support ticket about the issue but again (I'm not a programmer) I couldn't follow properly the answers. <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/5805">https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ticket/5805</a></p>
<p>They proposed to download an older version of JOSM which I tried (version 3376 on Windows). Now I can open the audio notes on JOSM but there's no sound, I tried different media players (VLC, SPlayer) but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Instead of an audio notes with OSMtracker you can take “Text note” for instance ( Street Paradise, Paved road). For us it's enough for the tags (street name and kind of street) but you can add what you want.
This note is then displayed next to the GPS trace on JOSM so it's easy after that to Edit the new GPS trace without being confused with many audio files and trying to match the time stamps of the audio files with the GPX files.</p>
<p>Here's a simple step-by-step guide (For Dummies) to go outside for a survey (recording GPS trace) with a smartphone and editing the GPS traces in JOSM and upload them in OSM server.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the application “OSMTracker
    for Android” (first download it :) )</li>
<li>Click on the “+” sign to start a
    new GPS trace.</li>
<li>Wait few seconds for GPS fix.</li>
<li>Click on “Text note” and write
    the name of the street and the state
    of the street (ex: Paved, Street
    Uluwatu).</li>
<li>To finish a GPS trace click on
    the casette icon at the upper right
    side to save the GPS trace.</li>
<li>Redo the steps 1 to 6 for adding
    more GPS traces.</li>
<li>Once back home for each GPS
    traces recorded on OSMTracker, click
    and hold on the GPS trace and click
    on “Export as GPX”.</li>
<li>Hook your phone up to your PC and
    on your PC navigate to the
    OSMtracker folder in the file
    directory.</li>
<li>Create a folder on the desktop
    and copy everything in the
    OSMtracker folder to that. There
    will likely be several folders if
    you've done several GPS trace.</li>
<li>Open JOSM (first download it :) )</li>
<li>In JOSM, go to File &gt; Open &gt;
     Navigate to the folder on your
     desktop &gt; Open it &gt; Open a GPS
     trace folder &gt; Select the .gpx file
     (there should only be one) and load
     that into JOSM</li>
<li>Next to the GPS trace you
     should see the “text note” (ex:
     Paved, Street Uluwatu).</li>
<li>Click on the download icon, the
     arrow down “Download Map data from
     the OSM server”.</li>
<li>Add the new street by selecting
     the icon “Draw nodes” and draw the
     street above the GPS trace.</li>
<li>For adding the tags, click on
     “Presets” and select the
     appropriate element (ex; highways,
     shops etc)</li>
<li>Fill the empty input boxes and
     click “Apply Preset”</li>
<li>Redo the steps 11 to 16 for the
     other GPS traces.</li>
<li>When you are done upload the
     GPS traces to OSM server by
     clicking on the icon with the green
     arrow up “Upload all changes in the
     active data layer to the OSM
     server”</li>
<li>Follow the instructions on the
     pop-up window (enter your OSM
     credentials)</li>
</ol>
<p>Voilà, it's done!</p>
