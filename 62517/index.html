<p>So I managed to set up both an osm tile server (which runs like a charm thanks to an exceptionally good tutorial on how to set it up) and uMAP locally and it mostly works (completely without internet access, just like it wanted it), but I experience two issues (which may or may not be connected - as I understand really VERY little of how Linux and all of this works behind the scenes). I can get things running with the help of a good tutorial, but I'm totally lost when something goes wrong. </p>
<p>Problem is: My tiles load in the background, I can access the uMAP-GUI, create a new map, even create POIs and everything - but I can't save my POIs. </p>
<p>However, I already had an issue during installation (I followed this guide: <a href="https://umap-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/):">https://umap-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/):</a></p>
<p>"umap collectstatic" doesn't work and gives me this error
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/ybon/Code/js/Leaflet.Storage</p>
<p>I don't know how important this is (and what collectstatic actually does...)- I was able to continue with my installation normally and still able to start my server. I tried so many things that I'm not sure if this was the first error message or not (I think there was something else about a directory missing before that and I created one by hand but not sure)</p>
<p>No idea where the file/directory is supposed to be coming from and why it is not there /where and when it should have been created and what else I can do. I was supposed to configure a couple of paths in a local.py - file but this one was not among them. I was supposed to change these paths (and created the folders respectively)</p>
<h1>For static deployment</h1>
<p>STATIC_ROOT = '/home/fayyy/umap/var/static'</p>
<h1>For users' statics (geojson mainly)</h1>
<p>MEDIA_ROOT = '/home/fayyy/umap/var/data'</p>
<p>That was during installation.</p>
<p>Now, when I try to save a POI I get "Problem in the response" and this error</p>
<p>OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/ybon/.virtualenvs/umap/var/uploads</p>
<p>Problem is, that this folder (probably?) doesn't even exist and I don't know WHERE I even should put it (or look for it to change its permissions)(since this is in a virtual environment as suggested in the installation guide).
There is no folder "ybon" anywhere anyway. I could create one but I guess that's not the way. </p>
<p>Can somebody please help me ? I've been trying to find a solution for hours. For someone experienced with Linux and all these shell commands this is probably crystal clear and super easy, but I absolutely have no clue what's going on...</p>
