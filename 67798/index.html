<p>Hi all, </p>
<p>I'm new here, I looked up and tried to find an answer to my question, but could find one... Sorry if this has been answered already!</p>
<p>So I made some small edits to my local hiking trail, because the different trails were not connected together and you couldn't navigate them on a map. On this image:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="https://help.openstreetmap.org/upfiles/a.jpg"/></p>
<p>-- 1 --
The 2 arrows are pointing short sections of the trail that were not mapped at all.
I connected the trails together (bottom arrow) and I connected the trail to the road (top arrow)
(these changes can be seen there:
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/470643312">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/470643312</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/128944297">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/128944297</a> )</p>
<p>-- 2 --
The box is showing a trail that wasn't appearing on the map for hiking.
I changed the "highway" tag of the line (that was already there) from "path" to "footway".
 - see my edit here: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/66693927">https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/66693927</a> 
 - and the history of changes here: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/666463749/history">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/666463749/history</a></p>
<p>So now after 3 or 4 days, the changes are appearing on Graphhopper - great!</p>
<p>However, when you plan a route it still won't navigate through any of these section I "fixed", as if they were nonexistent:
<a href="https://graphhopper.com/maps/?point=45.456202%2C-71.147418&amp;point=45.455901%2C-71.148663&amp;point=45.456007%2C-71.1498&amp;point=45.455916%2C-71.151881&amp;point=45.453659%2C-71.150165&amp;point=45.452454%2C-71.147246&amp;point=45.452063%2C-71.146302&amp;locale=fr-CA&amp;vehicle=foot&amp;weighting=fastest&amp;elevation=true&amp;use_miles=false&amp;layer=TF%20Cycle">In this Graphopper route</a>, the navigation should bring you from the start through steps 1,2,3,4 and 5 and then to the destionation, but instead it goes all around and you can see the portion of the trail it ignores...</p>
<p>Any idea why? What should I do for this to work out properly?
Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Laurenzo_214,
I used JOSM to have a look at your problem and found this :
Changeset 66649465 on Sentier du Col and Sentier du ruisseau Fortier on 1/26/19 7:54 AM with iD 2.13.0</p>
<p>If you want to do some serious editing in Osm you might want to have a look at JOSM it's a far better editor than iD, Imo</p>
<p>I checked your edits and found nothing wrong. I used the JOSM Validator to check the whole area and there were a few warnings that should NOT influence the routing there.</p>
<p>1) Warning in Josm :
Similar named ways :
Sentier du Col
Sentier du Mont-Mégantic
Grande-Ourse à Pléiades
Sentier du mont Mégantic
This is about a Crossing of 4 ways near Refuge Grande Ourse
Because JOSM sees a difference in "Sentier du Mont-Mégantic" and "Sentier du mont Mégantic" picky but we want a perfect map :)</p>
<p>I corrected this warning for you.</p>
<p>2) Warning in Josm :
Crossing waterway/highway Ruisseau Deloge,Sentier du Mont-Mégantic
Crossing waterway/highway Sentier du Ruissea de la Montagne,Ruisseau de la Montagne</p>
<p>The hiking path crosses a little stream on several places. I did not correct this because I don't know if there is a bridge or a place where you can wade through the stream. </p>
<p>I'm in The Netherlands and I use BaseCamp for routing. I don't have a map for Canada and could not find a recent enough Garmin extract. I downloaded a map in OsmAnd which I use for navigating on my Samsung Galaxy. OsmAnd also does not route there. The OsmAnd map is also not recent enough.</p>
<p>I downloaded this map :
<a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/">http://download.geofabrik.de/</a>
quebec-latest.osm.pbf, suitable for Osmium, Osmosis, imposm, osm2pgsql, mkgmap, and others. This file was last <strong>modified 11 hours ago</strong> and contains all OSM data up to 2019-01-29T21:15:02Z. File size: 403 MB;</p>
<p>I used QMapShack with the recent standard OpenstreetMap as a backgroud. I build a Database for Routino from the above geofabrik download and made a hiking route in QMapshack.</p>
<p>It all worked well. Your edits are routing correctly. Here is a link of the route on my Google Drive :</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqgbO9OH2iZ8ySBr6VBuvaof9GRfHOq5/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqgbO9OH2iZ8ySBr6VBuvaof9GRfHOq5/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>So, you can use <a href="http://download.geofabrik.de/">http://download.geofabrik.de/</a> Routino and QMapShack to make a hiking route from your latest edits or just wait till Graphopper gets a new update.</p>
<p>hth

<div class="comment-text"><p>Hi Gys,</p>
<p>Not sure I want to get into serious map editing right now, it's mostly that I find it very annoying when trying to get navigation stats (distance, elevation gain, etc.) and there are gaps in trails like this!! </p>
<p>Thanks for your answer and for taking the time to look at it :) Next time I go there I'll make sure to take note of which stream crossing has/doesn't have a bridge and I'll come back to fix that.</p>
<p>I also use OsmAnd, I hadn't though about looking there. I just updated the map and indeed the new trails are not showing yet. Thanks as well for the geofabrik suggestion :)</p></div>

<p>Using the new data for display can happen more quickly than using the same data for routing and navigation. I suggest you see if Graphhopper indicates anywhere how often they update their routing database from OSM.</p>
<p>For foot routing there shouldn't be any difference between between "path" and "footway". I personally use "footway" for wide smooth, generally hard surfaced, ways as found in suburban and urban areas. And I use "path" for the typically more narrow and unsurfaced ways that I hike on in the hills and mountains. My division between the two is generally based on deciding if a parent could push a baby stroller along the way, if so then footway if not then path.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks stf, I though updating display and routing/navigation was the same. Here is what they say in the FAQ:
"How long does it take after I updated the data on OpenStreetMap.org?
A change of the data at openstreetmap.org will be considered in our APIs usually after 2 days and at least every week. Except for the Geocoding API: the default provider can take up to 7 weeks and the nominatim provider should be updated within one week."</p>
<p></p><hr/>
<p>Regarding path vs footway, I understand what you are saying, but apparently there is a difference.</p>
<p>Before I made the change, there were no line/road/trail showing at all on the map in the red box area I outlined, but there was a line tagged "path" that I could see in the editor. </p>
<p>So I looked in the editor to find the difference between the other trails that I could see and the line that I couldn't see, and the only difference was the "highway" tag, which is why I changed it's value from "path" to "footway". And now, after my change, the trail is showing, so I guess there is a difference, but I can't tell more.</p><p></p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>The path was only added a few days ago (about a day before you edited it), so the reason you couldn't see it on the map is probably just that the tiles hadn't re-rendered yet. Usually the tiles at the higher zooms on the "Standard" rendering will update after about a minute, but sometimes there are delays or your browser shows a cached version. Given a bit more time, the highway=path would have shown.</p></div>
