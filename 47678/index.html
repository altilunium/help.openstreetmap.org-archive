<p>Hi,
My objective is to get tiles for the whole world, at zoom levels 0-9, one time, for offline use.  I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this.</p>
<p>I know the "proper" method is to download OSM data and then run a tile server.  However, this seems overly complicated considering the application.  I think I'd have to download the entire (60+GB?) OSM data set, despite having no need for most of the data that would only be valuable at higher zoom levels, and I would have to figure out how to set up style sheets, mapnik, etc, all to just run once.</p>
<p>I know there are ways to download tiles directly (eg JTileDownloader).  I also know there is a tile usage policy which says not to download large amounts of tile data. <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_usage_policy.">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_usage_policy.</a>  At what point is downloading considered excessive, eg I'd be doing a few hundred thousand tiles, once per year (or even less frequent), not multi-million tiles on a regular basis.  And the tiles are already rendered/cached, I would not need them regenerated.  So I think my application is not putting a major load on the servers, but perhaps someone could clarify that?  (Or should I just try to contact a system administrator directly to make this request?)</p>
<p>If there are other options, please let me know.  I know various resources say that Mapquest tiles can be bulk downloaded, but I'm not totally sure if terms have recently changed.</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback!</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Well, that page says "To avoid having your access blocked, please discuss your requirement with system administrators either via their wiki pages or on the IRC channel prior to starting." http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/System_Administrators  <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC</a> , so that's probably where I would start. Hundreds of thousands of tiles does sound significant, especially since most of those tiles would be empty (open sea) tiles.</p></div>
