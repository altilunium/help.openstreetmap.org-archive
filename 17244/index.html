<p>Edits / additions to the OSM database are made essentially when you upload them. There is no review or other manual checking beforehand, so yes, all your changes will be added.</p>
<p>If you don't see the additions on the the "standard" style map there are a number of possible reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>you are still viewing old tiles in your browser</li>
<li>you added a feature that is not rendered</li>
<li>you made a mistake editing</li>
</ul>
<p>It is always a good idea to include a permalink to the area you were working on, it makes it a lot easier and faster to check your edits.</p>
<p>In any case it seems as if you have added a number of untagged ways, since these have no properties they wont be rendered. You should add tags to indicate if they are roads, buildings or other features. As a beginner you are probably best off using the presets in the editor.</p>

sorry.i did not know that permalink option means "permanent link".
here it is:
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=24.36706&amp;lon=88.6296&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=M">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=24.36706&amp;lon=88.6296&amp;zoom=16&amp;layers=M</a></p>
<p>"Edits / additions to the OSM database are made essentially when you upload them."</p>
<p>i saved them that means they were uploaded.</p>
<p>"you are still viewing old tiles in your browser"
how to make sure that my browser is showing new tiles.
each time i just restarted my browser.</p>
<p>"you added a feature that is not rendered"
what type of features?
i have added only features that i was given in editing mode in browser.i have tagged more than 30 symbol(places).but it is now showing only 4  of them.all was added at same time.is that means rest of them gone ?
but in editing mode they ares still showing!</p>
<p>"In any case it seems as if you have added a number of untagged ways, since these have no properties they wont be rendered. You should add tags to indicate if they are roads, buildings or other features"</p>
<p>ahh,that makes sense now.
i will tag all of them.
but that also means lots of typing.
is that necessary when i have added proper symbol for each of them !</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I'm not quite sure how it happened, but if you look <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=potlatch2&amp;lat=24.366708&amp;lon=88.628634&amp;zoom=18">here</a> you'll see that the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/way/188166264">road in the middle of the screen</a> doesn't have any tags on it.  If you click on it in the in-browser editor the left-hand side of the screen will say "no tags set".  To the right of where it says "Unknown" there's a drop box that allows you to select the type of road.</p>
<p>Also, if you <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=potlatch2&amp;lat=24.365687&amp;lon=88.628395&amp;zoom=20">zoom in a bit</a> you can see that it's not quite joined - it's important that roads that do join in reality are joined on the map, so that routing software can work correctly.</p>
<p>If you have a look at the wiki pages that are linked from <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide">here</a> you may find some helpful information.</p></div>

As they're small roads within a university complex I'd have thought that "Minor Road" or "Service Road" would be more appropriate?</p></div>
