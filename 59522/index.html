<p>I will fix the Trailforks GPX download for trails to contain blank &lt; time &gt; info so GPX files can be uploaded. Update should be pushed this evening.</p>
<p>OSM is frankly a mess for consistency of proper mountain bike trail tagging. We try and use the tags to filter out ways that are mtb trails on our <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/blog/view/trailforks-custom-basemap/">custom basemap</a> but we have to cast a broad net and end up hiding more than we want. So recently I've instead started scanning the entire OSM database against our own trails database to find matches based on spatial match. About a 30m buffer around the length of the trail. We then hide OSM ways from our basemap if they have a match and include all other ways. We want to show hiking trails and dirt roads from OSM on our basemap.</p>
<p>You can also see the OSM way that matches a TF trail on the stats page for a trail, Strava segment as well.
<a href="https://www.trailforks.com/trails/expresso/stats/">https://www.trailforks.com/trails/expresso/stats/</a></p>
<p>The nice thing about using the OSM export though is it already contains some of the OSM tags to properly designate the way as a mountain bike trail as well as a link back to Trailforks for more info on the trail. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt; tag k="name" v="Big Bear Down"/&gt;
&lt; tag k="highway" v="path"/&gt;
&lt; tag k="bicycle" v="designated"/&gt;
&lt; tag k="surface" v="dirt"/&gt;
&lt; tag k="source:name" v="Trailforks.com"/&gt;
&lt; tag k="website" v="https://www.trailforks.com/trails/big-bear-down/"/&gt;
&lt; tag k="mtb:scale:imba" v="4"/&gt;
</code></pre>

I am also not clear on what to do with a trail that gets progressively smaller - it starts as an access road / gravel road, turns into hiking/mountain biking trail and gets even narrower to hiking trail only. What is the right way to record that in OSM?</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/14198/pbcnp">@pbcnp</a> For a trail that changes as it goes along, I'd suggest tagging the measurable attributes as they change - things like surface, width, etc.  It's a question that's perhaps more suited to one of the mailing lists / forums than here as it's not really a "question" with an easy "answer".  A bunch of people (including me) could probably chip in on how they combine OSM data to match the thing they want to represent / route along.</p></div>

<p>But I noticed that you did insert the &lt;time&gt;0&lt;/time&gt; tags - Thanks! I think it will need more than a 0 put in there. is there a chance you could replace it with time of download in the following format:

That seems to do the trick.</p></div>

<p>Thank you in your interest in OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>While I've not looked at it in detail, I believe there are at least the following points you need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>legal: the information available on trailforks.com seems to be proprietary at least there is no indication that it is available on a licence that would allow its use in OSM</li>
<li>technical: "trails" in OSM tend not to be one simple "way", they tend to be collections of existing way segments, listed in a so called relation object. With other words you will need to check which parts of the trail are already present in OSM, add what is missing and then create a relation that contains all the segments (that last part is actually easy)</li>
<li>fitness for purpose/verifiability: OSM is not a repository for private favourite trails. With other words what you are adding should be verifiable in one way or the other, typically in the case of trails they should be signposted.</li>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I believe I have considered these:
- Legal: excerpt from www.trailforks.com: "We have an open data policy, we don't think the trail data is something proprietary we need to protect. So you and others are free to take data out of our system for your own needs. If you want to develop your own app, go for it, use our API or get a KML data dump...." they make the data available in .osm format specifically to be shared on OpenStreetMap.
- Technical: When I look at .gpx file I can download from trailforks it looks like a gps trace that i regularly upload to OSM. Except it doesn't have the &lt;time&gt; tag, so I can't upload it to OSM. I am not really sure I understand your point here. Can you please look at this .osm file and let me know it has the problem you are referring to? <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/region/pass-powderkeg/trails/osm/">https://www.trailforks.com/region/pass-powderkeg/trails/osm/</a>
- Fitness for purpose/verifiability: In the Crowsnest Pass, Alberta, Canada, Trailforks is the only place that has biking trails maps. This isn't just my personal favourite trail repository - the local club maintains this database of all trails they built, map and maintain. It is the most complete database there is, and most of the trails are signposted.</p></div>
