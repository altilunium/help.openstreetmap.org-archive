<p>I have searched for weeks on how to change my map style and have finally got an OSM.xml file (generated from OSM-Bright theme with Tilemill etc, that I am happy with here:  <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B6Lb5ThDkG8ZakR2OXJHTDRQUUk">https://googledrive.com/host/0B6Lb5ThDkG8ZakR2OXJHTDRQUUk</a></p>
<p>My tile server is using the exact steps shown here: <a href="http://switch2osm.org/">http://switch2osm.org/</a> the server can be seen here: <a href="http://osmtileserver.cloudapp.net/osm/slippymap.html?zoom=11&amp;lat=-39.44448&amp;lon=176.85734&amp;layers=B0">http://osmtileserver.cloudapp.net/osm/slippymap.html?zoom=11&amp;lat=-39.44448&amp;lon=176.85734&amp;layers=B0</a></p>
<p>I have been searching for how I can update the styling of my tiles but with no luck. I assume I need to replace the osm.xml file with my new one; however it doesn't work (instead I get a mixture of out of date tiles and pink tiles (pink where the tile image isn't loading). </p>
<p>Could this be because my OSM.xml file is invalid? If so how can I get logs for the issue at hand? Am I following the correct way to replace a style? </p>
<p>I have tried to use the url method for marking tiles as dirty but it appears to not do anything. I have also have two ubuntu installs (one locally in hyper-v and the other one is the one linked. I have tried on both, with the same result).</p>

<p>Please run renderd with the -f flag (instead of starting it via an init script) you should then see what ever is going wrong.</p>
<p>One of the common problems when using a TileMill generated style is that it generates one that is valid for a more recent version of Mapnik than the installed one. A frequent issue is that older version do not support the "Parameters" section, which you can simply delete. further you need to check if the values in the "Datasource" section (access config for your DB) are correct for your server installation.</p>

<p>You have hit the issue on the head in that I do have errors around the parameters section (which is kinda expected I guess, considering that they have windows file paths etc). Is it better to upgrade my mapnik? or is it better to just remove the parameters. </p>
<p>Am I making things more difficult for myself by using Tilemill in windows? The thing that is i guess confusing me is that the OSM-Bright project seems to link 3 files into tile mill from shp files. Is there a way to not do that.</p></div>

<p>just gives a 404, suggesting that Apache doesn't know that mod_tile is supposed to be serving tiles via renderd there.  As Simon says, "Please run renderd with the -f flag" and share the output via e.g. pastebin or public on Google Drive.<br/>
</p>
<p>There are at least 4 sets of "how to set up a tile server" instructions on switch2osm.org, and what might be the problem will depend on which one you've followed, which will probably depend on which version of Ubuntu you're on and will determine which versions of e.g. Postgres, Mapnik etc. you're running.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to provide a few more details?</p>
<p>Also - was your new tile server working with a standard OSM style before you tried to use your OSM-Bright based one?</p></div>

<p>Wrt the shape files, most OSM styles use shapefiles for coast lines and other large generalised features etc. at lower zoom levels instead of retrieving them from the database. One of the reason for doing that is that coast lines break really really often and you are better off using a static version.</p></div>

<p>I'm guessing that you exported the osm.xml from within TileMill?  When I've hit this sort of problem in the past I've just changed the relevant files to the correct path with a text editor.  However a better option might be to export from the TileMill project via "<a href="https://github.com/mapbox/carto">carto</a>" instead (I can't find a specific citation for that though - I may have seen it via IRC; and I haven't tried to move styles from Windows to Linux for a while).</p></div>

<p>Apologies if I I am completely missing the point here, but that's the approach that worked for me in the past.  Specifically for me it was items in TileMill's download cache that were being referenced, but this was a year or so and several TileMill versions ago and things may have changed.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>The coastlines in your database are just lines. Turning them into area's requires logic that is too complex for a stylesheet. On top of that, if you are rendering a tile too far from the coast the renderer won't even see the coastlines in the database. That is why Tilemill wants you to use the shapefiles.</p>
<p>Edit: Are the coastlines present in your database anyway? Osm2PgSQL used to leave them out by default.</p></div>
