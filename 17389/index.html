<p>I have been looking in Germany and other "Example" countries, and still have not found a definitive answer.  Some people put the Tags on the building polygon some put it on the area polygon when available.  Some add the tags to a entrance node to the building and some add the tags to a node and move it to the center of the building while some move it near the entrance.</p>
<p>Which way helps OSM the most and is the most useful way to tag them.  I already know to use the addr: tags instead of relations since it is quicker to parse and use.  Please chime in and give your case for the best way to tag.    I want to start adding addresses and Store POIs in commercial districts and would like some solid advice.<br/>

Please give me any helpful suggestions.<br/>
</p>
<p>Also are there any good examples you could link to, because that would be great.  I like learning by examining great examples.  P.S. I am not that fond of relations but can do them if need be, I really want the best for this project. </p>

<p>My POV of Best Practice:<br/>
Nodes are the easiest and fastest way to map a POI. If a user knows details of a POI but not the outline of the building and no imagery is available it is the most logic thing to use.</p>
<p>When there is a way for the building, put the data on the way. Don't add the data to a node and the way. This kind of redundancy is not wanted.</p>
<p>Exceptions: When the building contains multiple POI you can<br/>
a) put the POI data on the node for the entrance which leads to the POI in real life or, if that isn't possible<br/>
b) just add the POI data to a node inside the building.<br/>
</p>
<p>For relations: It is mostly discouraged using them. They break quite easily and are hard to restore. Also I map quite a lot but have seen only ten (or so) of them. Additionally: At least I haven't heard of any tools checking for address relations. So maybe you put a lot of work into them but they will hardly get used.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I have used relations for buildings with courtyards, also for areas that are related yet non physically next to each other.  It is a pain which is why I don't like to use them.  It is only slightly easier if I use Merkaartor and start from scratch.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Re: relations. I guess it depends where you map. associatedStreet relations is what we locally decided what is easier to map, and they are supported by nominatim. We have roughly 1500+ in a fairly rural area of about 300 square km (currently 1805 relations for an area extract, but there are a few multipolygons and boundaries in there too).</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>We locally decided to standardize on addr:street and removed the few associatedStreet relations I had created before because they added unnecessary complexity and served no useful purpose.</p>
<p>Using addr:street, combined with editor presets, makes a common beginner task - adding or correcting an address - as easy as "click on the building, notice the 'address' dialog, type in the house number and street name in those text boxes." I fail to understand how associatedStreet could be considered <em>easier</em> than that.</p></div>
