<p>Hi guys,
recently I've searched some information about using OSM datas for aviation. I saw that there are already nice tags for airports like parkings, apron and runways but nothing for the navigation like VORs, AEROWAYS, FIXES and REPORT POINTS (that are compulsory for make a flight plan). It would be nice using OSM data for flight planning...
Thanks,</p>

<p>Most information relevant to instrument flight - reporting points, fixes, airspace, as well as arrival and departure patterns - are defined without reference to the ground. A reporting point might be overhead some visible landmark but it will still be officially recorded at being at position so-and-so, rathern than "whereever that landmark is".</p>
<p>This means that most of this is not visible on the ground and thus should not be in OSM. At the same time, because that kind of information is completely independent of what's on the ground, so it is easy to keep air navigation data in a separate database and just display it on top of OSM when rendering. </p>
<p>It is possible to use software written for OSM to operate and edit a completely separate database which is probably what you should be looking at. You would only have to install the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Rails_port">Rails port</a> and then you can hammer away at it with your favourite OSM editor, possibly creating special presets and rendering rules for that editor. Later you would set up a rendering engine to render tiles from your database, and display them on top of OSM base tiles.</p>

I just asked that because I saw the beatiful project OpenSeaMap, that show you everything you need for sea navigation. IMHO I think that it can be the same for something like OpenAviationMap.</p>
<p>In instrumental flight fixes, airspace and points are extremely linked to the ground and they were created for keep a safe flight, without the collision with natural or artificial obstacles, noise reduction and so on.</p>
<p>The Rails port would be nice for me, thanks, but I was searching something that would help also other users.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>The idea with the Rails port is that someone in the aviation community sets it up to capture aviation data, and it is then avaialable for everyone else to contribute to. - As far as I am aware, OpenSeaMap is mostly drawn from actual observable objects, like buoys. If OpenSeaMap were to add un-observable marine navigation data to OSM they would be told to use their own database too (with the exception of national boundaries, which are generally considered acceptable to OSM because of their high importance even though not always observable).</p></div>

But people would probably object if you placed these as objects of their own.</p></div>

<p>You'll have to forgive us, but there may not be as many aviation experts involved in OpenStreetMap as we would like. </p>
<p>Are the features you talk about physical features on the landscape, or are they just points in space that are designated as important to aviation in some way? If the former, we can probably map them, but if they're not observable in some way, they almost certainly don't belong in OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>Also, bear in mind that any data added to OpenStreetMap can be edited (or vandalised) at any time, so it may not be suitable for use in such a safety-critical application as aviation.</p>

<p>The remark about boundary is very accurate .....
I am also interested in the mapping for aviation ..... Reporting points are very interesting, but also air spaces, that clearly have no connexions with the ground for their boundaries : there is already a proposed feature for that in osm. Join the discussion ?
I will have a look to trails as indicated.</p>
