<p>Recently <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/note/725421">a note</a> I'd commented on was resolved, without action, with the statement "Individual units in private residential developments are not mapped for reasons of privacy."</p>
<p>I'm reasonably experienced on OSM, and this is news to me, and the existence of the <code>addr:unit=*</code> tag seems to contradict this. Is there any validity to their statement?</p>

<p>I don't see how a unit# in any way differs from a housenumber. I would agree it is common practice to map the units, at least if the premises are somehow accessible by the public or visitors. But we even map building numbers inside factories for example.</p>
<p>Still the other comment was valid: From the position of the comment it is not clear where this address is to be put.</p>

<p>It appears to me that these numbers are signed in a visible way on a public street -- this picture shows 55 and 56: <a href="https://openstreetcam.org/details/28476/1338/track-info">https://openstreetcam.org/details/28476/1338/track-info</a></p>
<p>If these are indeed the unit numbers, then I'd say their inclusion in OSM 100% legit. But as you said in your note comment, there's no way of knowing where to map unit 65, or what the scope of 10220 Dunoon Drive is. And since this is a 3-year-old note from a user with no map contributions, I wouldn't hold out much hope for clarification.</p>
<p>I'm guessing the commenter DENelson83 isn't familiar with this style of addressing and presumed that unit numbers referred to individual apartments in a residential building, accessed by a shared entrance. Those, IMO and by common practice, don't belong on the map. (You can still list the apartments listed for an address or entrance using <code>addr:flats</code>, but we don't try to map the position of each unit in the building's interior.)</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Looking at the previously mentioned OpenStreetCam pictures I don't have the feeling you would have to be trespassing to survey. </p>
<p>But I think it is even common practice to map such things even on only semi-public premises. If you get legitimate access to a site and the owners don't want to keep it obscure by all means map what you see.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Hi DENelson83, thanks for clarifying, I'd not understood that's what you meant in the note comment. </p>
<p>Lets set aside this particular location, and whether you need to trespass to access the address unit number. I really don't care about that particular location.</p>
<p>I agree that we shouldn't trespass to do mapping, but there is plenty of valid reasons for a OSM contributor to be in a private place, and if the contributor wants to add some data that can only be obtained while on private property I'm convinced that is fine.</p>
<p>An example might be a delivery company, who's in a private complex, and adds unit numbers within that complex. That could be very useful for delivery drivers, and they have a valid reason to be there. They are not trespassing. Another example could be a private camp, that only accepts paying guests. Those guests may map while they are there, despite it being private. In either case it's helpful to remember to include access tags.</p>
