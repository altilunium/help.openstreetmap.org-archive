<p>Please advise how to code sites and buildings (e.g. large industrial or commercial) with multiple entrances, each having different street addresses (at least house numbers): <br/>
(Q1) each entrance a node (building=entrance) + address information? However, this does not appear on the map :-(<br/>
(Q2) should this node be part of the site's / building's border line, or a separate POI? I think, an entrance is part of the building and thus should be part of the site's / building's surrounding polygon.<br/>
(Q3) Sometimes (e.g. large commercial areas) have entrances with a street address associated with that entrance. Would this still be a building=entrance type of node? Should this node be part of the polygon surrounding the site? Or an extra node? <br/>
(Q4) Large appartment buildings may also have several entrances with separate house numbers. I do not want to add all house numbers to the building's address since the building is quite long and I think it is important to know which end has which address. Again I would like to know: One POI for each entrance (building=entrance)? Should this node be part of the building's polygon? Or separate? Or should I still split the building into seperate buildings, one for each address?<br/>
(Q5) Not every building can be split into separate building polygons, one for each address: There are large business buildings with several entrances which cannot (artificially) be split into several buildings.<br/>
Thank you.</p>

<li>The <em>addr:housenumber</em> tag appears on the map. But the important thing is that routers and search engines finds the address.</li>
<li>You should add the <em>building=entrance</em> node to the building because entrances are part of the building outline. If you do not have the building outline you do not have to do so.</li>
<li>If the node is not an entrance to a <strong>building</strong> then you do not tag it as <em>building=entrance</em>. You can still tag the address to a node and even tag it with <em>barrier=gate</em> if that is more appropriate.</li>
<li>For longer stretches of housenumbers you can add them to a way that you tag with <em><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr:interpolation">addr:intrapolation</a></em>.</li>
<li>That is where you use <em>building=entrance</em> to add several entrances and addresses to the same building. There is no reason there should be only one <em>building=entrance</em> assosiated with a single building.</li>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Thank you, this helps. As for #4: I understood addr:interpolation is only for ways but I have a situation where several long appartment buildings are not along the road but at a right angle to the road, worse: the street has an even-odd numbering scheme such that one building has housenumbers 10 (next to the road) and 12 (a little away from the road). According to your answer to #2, I will now add the entrances with their respective house numbers and hope they will show up on the map. Thank you, again.</p></div>
