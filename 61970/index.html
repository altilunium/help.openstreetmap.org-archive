<p>I am aware of a number of nearby private residential communities with several entrances. The main entrance is for residents and guests to enter, the latter checking in at the guard booth. Other entrance gates don't have a guard booth, and may be locked for maintenance access only, or may be open to residents with a passcode.</p>
<p>Streets beyond the guard booth are tagged highway=residential access=private. The entrance node is barrier=gate or barrier=lift_gate (should this also be access=private or is that unnecessary due to that tag being on the streets?). But what should I do with the back gate? How do I tell people reading the map and routing software to use the main gate?</p>
<p>Here is an example of a back gate (this one for maintenance only) and how it causes problems with routing (the correct route is to go all the way north to Oren Brown Road and in the main entrance):

<p>I think the barrier is mapped correctly. When I tested it with graphhopper routing didn't go via that gate (using either foot or car). I think the problem may be with OSRM, it is not as good as it used to be. Routers don't use new data for a number of days in my experience. The private tag seems to block all routing, which is correct. If you route to somewhere inside the private area the router will take you as close as possible via public roads or paths which isn't that useful. I doubt that any routers use guest tags for the guest entrance, but that is where visitors need to be routed to. In answer "how do i indicate.. " You could call it " Main Gate or Guest Entrance" and routing should go to that IF INCLUDED in the address of your end point.   </p>
