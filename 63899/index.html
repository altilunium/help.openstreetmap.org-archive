<p>I have reviewed all of the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Brewery">brewery-related wiki pages</a> and have found that craft breweries with tasting rooms are <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/BC_Craft_Breweries#Currently_in_OSM">tagged very inconsistently around Vancouver and British Columbia</a>.</p>
<p>These establishments are full-on breweries (i.e. industrial sites) but have a built-in tasting room where customers can come sample their beers and buy some to take home with them.</p>
<p>I would like to switch to more consistent tagging, but I'm not sure exactly what the best tags are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How should I tag a brewery with a tasting room but only token food options like chips and pretzels? <code>amenity=bar</code>, <code>microbrewery=yes</code> and <code>craft=brewery</code>?</p>
</li>

<p>How should I tag a brewery with a tasting room and significant food options? <code>amenity=pub</code>, <code>microbrewery=yes</code> and <code>craft=brewery</code>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I also add <code>shop=alcohol</code> to all of them since they offer they sell their own beers (either in bottles/cans or reuseable containers)?</p>

<p>If the whole building belongs to the brewery, I'd tag the building with <code>craft=brewery</code> (or <code>industrial=brewery</code> for large scale operations) and put a node inside for the tasting room, <code>amenity=bar/pub/restaurant</code> etc, depending on the feel of the place. For a smaller brewing outfit I'd probably just add <code>craft=brewery</code> to the amenity.</p>
<p>Indicate food options with <code>cuisine=snack/pub/burger</code> etc.</p>
<p>I don't see any problem with adding <code>shop=alcohol</code> directly to the amenity node, but there might be reasons to make it its own node: If it's physically separated, has different hours, name, selection (ie you can buy liquor at the pub but only beer to go), payment options, etc.</p>
<p>As I understand it, <code>microbrewery=yes</code> is for establishments that are primarily amenities but include a small brewing operation onsite, while <code>craft=brewery</code> is for businesses that are primarily breweries, though they often include tasting rooms. Sometimes it's a blurry distinction.</p>

<p>I'd suggest as separate features for the brewery and bar.  See <a href="https://map.atownsend.org.uk/maps/map/map.html#zoom=18&amp;lat=53.27676&amp;lon=-0.793414">here</a> for an example (which is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/359616375">here</a> in OSM).  I wouldn't worry about what does or does not get rendered in OSM's "Standard" map - that lags behind in a number of areas.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>The example you gave looks a lot like Red Truck: a brewery and an adjoining pub in two separate buildings (or sets of buildings). Unfortunately, that's the exception in Vancouver. Most craft breweries here have their tasting room and beer store in the same building as the brew tanks. In fact, in the case of Storm, you even have to walk on spilled beer in between fermenters in order to get to the counter where you can get your container filled (i.e. the beer store). Is there any downside to tagging a single way / node with three different things (<code>craft=brewery</code>, <code>amenity=bar</code> and <code>shop=alcohol</code>)? Will renderers be smart enough to have one of these take precendence? Does one of these uses need to be flagged as "primary" somehow?</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>See <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/221456768">this example</a> for a large "craft=brewery" building with a pub node inside it, maybe that is more what you're looking for?</p>
<p>That approach has been used for ages with post offices inside shops and should work here too.  A pedant might complain that actually the brewery only takes up the left-hand side of the building (there are railings that separate the "bar" part from the "brewery" part so that you don't get run over by a fork-lift).  About the only one I can think of without that separation is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3676981225">here</a>.</p></div>
