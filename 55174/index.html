<p>I stumbled upon an island not rendering properly.  I have made several attempts to correct this by trying something a little different with each of the three islands that don't seem to appear on the map.</p>
<p>If anyone could take a look and let me know what is wrong it surely would be appreciated.</p>

Tags like place... are unnecessary (many sw-s create see/water instead of lan).

<p>It's because Ship Island is only a boundary way, it has no coastline. Notice the lines surrounding the other islands, the ones that render (show up). On JOSM they show up as a heavy black line. Ship Island doesn't have it. If you trace the outline of the island and tag it natural=coastline it will show up as an island. You need to trace it in a counterclockwise fashion.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>When I looked again after your edits Ship Island still wasn't visible on the OSM slippy map either as a boundary or as an island. That's probably because you used the same way twice, once as a boundary, and again as coastline. </p>
<p>I would duplicate the boundary, delete the existing tags, adjust it so it fits the contours of the water line better, then add the tag natural=coastline to the new way. Alternatively, seeing as the island is small, you could just draw a new coastline from scratch. </p>
<p>Pig Island has the same problem. The boundary is there, the name is there, but there is no coastline to define the enclosed area as an island in the sea. It displays as an administrative unit with name=Pig Island but without a coastline is otherwise invisible.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/5390/escada"></a><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/5390/escada">@escada</a>, yes, that's a factor I forgot about. In JOSM, newly added coastlines appear right away but they take a while to propagate to the slippy map display. I'm not sure how long before they do. Coastlines don't appear on the slippy map as black lines, they are merely a place where land coloration changes to blue.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/9888/drew_nl"></a><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/9888/drew_nl">@Drew</a>, considering this it's probably best to give your edits some more time to become visible. I have used a coastline way and a boundary way together in Alaska and on the slippy map only the boundary is visible as a separate entity.
Here is a part of that way:
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=67.63419%2C%20-164.1889#map=16/67.6336/-164.1851">http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=67.63419%2C%20-164.1889#map=16/67.6336/-164.1851</a></p>
<p>Changes to this boundary show up right away but maybe that's because it marks a nature_reserve, which gets special treatment. Are administrative boundaries rendered differently?</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Another interesting part of this puzzle is that Greenspond Island does show up. It is tagged as natural=coastline and boundary=adminstrative. However, it is also tagged with admin_level=8 while neither Ship or Pig Islands have an admin_level tag.</p>
<p>Could this be the reason they don't render?</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>As I wrote in the other cross-post in the OpenStreetMap Forum: I made both some corrections yesterday (removal of duplicated ways and adding of missing tags), and advice you to wait several weeks before reviewing this. Honestly, I have seen it take up to a month for a similar issue related to coastline and islands to show up properly on the slippy map.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I plan on waiting until the month end updates, I would appreciate, however, that no one else go in and make changes as mboeringa took away the changes I made on the smaller islands.  I made changes on the larger Green Island which seem to have worked unless some one else had made other changes.  I will then correct the smaller two islands after the March update in early April.   I'll then post back here with an update of what worked and what never. Thanks everyone.</p></div>
