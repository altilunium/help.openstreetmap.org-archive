<p>I'm teaching a high school geography class and would like my students to make a map of their neighborhood (with relevant landmarks, roads, etc.).  Rather than doing it on paper, I was hoping to have them create it electronically, but I can't find a free program that would allow them to create a map.  Can anyone recommend a software program that would allow my students to create a map from scratch?</p>

<p>I would recomend you have the students contribute to the OSM project instead of creating a map from scratch that would be disregarded after they hand it in. It would make the students learn about helping out the comunity and sharing. It would be fun for the students to see their assignments be used on a public map and downloadable to satnavs.</p>
<p>The most common editors in use with OSM is <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch">Potlatch</a>, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM">JOSM</a> and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Merkaartor">Merkaartor</a>. Potlatch is the easiest to learn and is aimed for beginers. It is possible to include Potlatch <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch_2/Deploying_Potlatch_2">on your own web site</a> however to be able to use it without OSM requires you to deploy your own version of the API witch may be dificult. It would be even harder to have seperate datasets for each student, however it is easy to see what a student have done.</p>
<p>JOSM and Merkaator are standalone applications that may be harder to use, but they have the ability to work offline as well and each student can hand in their own map in a .osm format.</p>

<p>The basic exercise would seem to me best constructed in a way that doesn't touch the main OSM database, handing in the map in a .osm format as suggested, although students (particularly the ones looking for "extra credit" who might be taking the exercise more seriously) could be told how to go the further mile and contribute any good quality data they produce to the project (avoiding duplicates!)</p></div>

<p>I'd also review their final results to ensure incorrect information doesn't remain on the map once the students are complete.  Naming a house as Jane Doe's house is correct for the student, but could cause problems with privacy as well as could be just too much information.<br/>
Satellite or aerial imagery is a very valuable tool for mapping as well, it can help the students understand how their map relates with where they live.  Hopefully in your area you have higher resolution Bing or Yahoo! imagery.</p>

<p>Will they be using windows?,a gps? or pacing out distances, a compass or crude angle measuring devices.

<p>JOSM is well suited for this task and I personally find it much easier to use than Potlatch (from the very beginning, not after years of expirience). <a href="http://www.qgis.org/">Quantum GIS</a> seems very interesting and maybe even better than JOSM, but I have not tried it myself yet.<br/>
Not knowing how old/smart/computer literate your students are, but I would give them the freedom to choose any software they see fit. <br/>
</p>
<p>I would not force any students to contribute their mapping efforts to OSM database, but giving it as an option is probably a good idea.<br/>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Thank you for the reaction. It is not mandatory to say what is wrong, but I believe it is a good practice.<br/>
JOSM is the only offline mapping tool I have a positive experience with, Quantum GIS looks a bit less OSM-bound and more professional (only impression).<br/>
The recommendation of free choice of software comes from my assumption that this would be some sort of homework for the students to do on their own computers. My experience from schools is, that if teachers need a free program to be installed it is no problem, but it can be different in other schools.</p></div>
