<p>So, I want to map a building which has an inner courtyard, and parts, which have different properties.</p>
<p>I made a relation which has <code>type=multipolygon</code> and <code>building=hospital</code> (because it's a hospital building).</p>
<p>Now, the outer line has no tags, and is in the relation as <code>outer</code>. The courtyard, also has no tags, and is in the relation as <code>inner</code>. So far so good.</p>
<p>The part of the building with different properties, touches the outer ring on some sections. It has a couple tags, like <code>building:levels=2</code>, and <code>roof:shape=gabled</code>, etc.</p>
<p>It is in the relation as <code>part</code>, but now I'm getting an error in JOSM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multipolygon outer way shares segment(s) with other ring (1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I know how to make buildings made up of several parts, and I also know how to make buildings with pateos, and other "holes", etc. But combining the two seems a bit like an impossibility, because for a building with holes, the relation is a <code>type=multipolygon</code>, and <code>type=building</code> if it's a building that consists of several parts.</p>
<p>So how do I go about this?</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/5390/escada">@escada</a> that'exactly how I left things right now. As for whether that's correct or not: I have no idea. I'd imagine the <code>building:part</code> object should be also part of the relation, but I really don't know. It seems to work wouth having the building part added to the relation. It's just that I've seen it being part of the relation in other buildings, hence I thought that's the correct way of going about this.</p></div>

<p>You cannot use one relation as a building relation and a multipolygon relation at the same time. Instead, after creating your multipolygon, you would need to create a second relation, this time using <code>type=building</code> instead of <code>type=multipolygon</code>. Add the multipolygon relation, not the outer way, as the <code>outline</code> member.</p>
<p>Note, however, that building relations are optional (and indeed unnecessary) for almost all buildings – see my <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/60330/how-do-you-create-a-relation-between-a-building-and-3d-building-parts/60332">answer</a> to a related question. So you can probably avoid the problem by simply not using one. :)</p>
