<p>When I download the GPX file onto my Garmin Edge or onto MapMyRide website, it has extra connections from the start point or the finish point.  The start point if often at the middle of the route, instead of one end of it.  So the route ends up having extra zigzags and extra erroneous points and connections.</p>
<p>I tried the route editor in MapMyRide, but it didn't work.</p>

After downloading, I dump directly to my Garmin Edge 800, or open it in MapMyRide or RideWithGPS websites.
In addition to the route, itself, there are extra "connection lines" from the start point or finish point to elsewhere along the route.  Also, the start point often is situated in the middle of the route, instead of one end of it.
I don't think I am doing anything wrong, but there are obviously errors in the routes when downloaded.</p></div>

<p>With regard to the Mosel, I presume that you're talking about <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/4281">this relation</a>.  It <a href="http://ra.osmsurround.org/analyzeRelation?relationId=4281&amp;_noCache=on">looks OK to me</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps whatever software you're loading the GPX into is making some incorrect assumptions about the data?  Maybe it's assuming that the data is ordered, when relation data generally isn't, although this one does seem to be.  If you click "show more info" on the relation analyser page you can read what it's doing, which includes sorting the relation so that you don't see "links back to Koblenz".<br/>
</p>
<p>If you want a sorted version of an unsorted relation, load it into JOSM and sort it there.  You'll also find (using the relation analyser) that some relations in OSM aren't complete - there are gaps that haven't been mapped yet.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Thank you Someone Else, and thank you Andy Mackey.  Yes, there are other sources of bike routes, but most are shorter rides.  The OSM bike routes at Waymarked Trails, seem to be the best and most comprehensive. For instance, the entire Rhine River bike route is there.
The GPX files for each route download to my PC as one file, but they are actually made up of many smaller files for each segment of the entire bike route; some segments are only a few meters long.
The GPX file, when converted to KML, opens fine in Google Maps and has no extra connections and extra lines.
But Someone Else is correct: it is the order of these sub files that appear to cause the problem.  I am not very tech savvy, but somehow the sub-files need to be arranged in the correct order (from start point, that is from one end of the route, to the other end) and then merged again into one file.  I have not worked with JOSM, but I suppose I have to learn it, so as to make use of the GPX files at Waymarked Trails (OSM).</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>This problem happens with ALL the bike routes I have downloaded.  In response to SomeoneElse's comment, here are the routes I have tried:
Mosel 4281, SAAR 107338, RHINE 2171555, Bodensee-Konigsee 2166895, Iller 12186, Algau 1997420.</p>
<p>All of these show fine in Googel Earth (kml file), but when downloaded directly to my Garmin Unit or when downloaded to MapMyRide or similar websites, there are extra connections.  I suspect that's because the various sub-segments of the entire route are not in order, so the mid-point may become the start point, etc.
MapMyRide allows limited Edit capability, but it is very time consuming.  I will try JOSM. I hope there is an easier way for the public to make use of these GPX bike route files, as the Waymarked Trails is a great resource.<br/>

<p>Here is an exact reference to a GPX file for [D5] Saar-Mosel-Main:</p>
<p><a href="http://cycling.waymarkedtrails.org/en/routebrowser/2616417/gpx">http://cycling.waymarkedtrails.org/en/routebrowser/2616417/gpx</a></p>
<p>From this specific GPX file we can see that there are multiple tracks within it. Generally GPX handling programs should not interpolate <em>between</em> tracks unless there is an specific option to do so. If any order is applied to the tracks it should be in the order they are in the GPX file.</p>
<p>I think this route is split into several sections due to parts going around roundabouts or other bits that are one way. I think the route relations in OSM should be continuous so that they can be composed as few tracks as possible.</p>
<p>Possibly it should have 'forward' and 'reverse' routes depending on the direction one is going in to cater for these subtle differences.</p>
<p>There was an extra bit here that shouldn't be part of the relation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.138589&amp;lon=7.174056&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=C">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.138589&amp;lon=7.174056&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=C</a></p>
<p>Update: Fixed OSM data here on 2013/04/13 </p>
<p>Also in my opinion waymarkedtrails should actually be returning GPX routes not tracks!</p>

<p>As <a href="/users/3300/robbieonsea"><a href="/users/3300/robbieonsea">@robbieonsea</a></a> has pointed out, the files are perfectly valid. They comprise several distinct tracks (GPX 'trk' elements) within the one file, which are not ordered from start to end of the route - indeed, given that an OSM route can have branches and loops, it would be impossible for them to be consistently ordered. There is nothing in the GPX specification to require that one track starts where the last one ended.</p>
<p>So the files are not "corrupted". They are just not suitable for the purpose for which you're using them, and you are using software which appears to make assumptions not borne out by the GPX specification. But your use case is not the only one - so please don't claim that there are "obviously errors".</p>
<p>If you believe WaymarkedTrails.org could provide more useful GPXs, then you can of course e-mail the maintainer and ask - nicely. But please be a little more humble than you have been here and try not to use phrases like "What is the point" and capital-letter shouting.</p>
<p>(For what it's worth, I've personally created linear, continuous .gpx track files of several UK cycle routes. The programming effort required to do this is not trivial, with lots of special-case logic required for roundabouts and the like, and it often requires significant manual cleanup of the data.)</p>

<p>Have you tried the Garmin software such as Basecamp or Mapsourse? it's free from the Garmin web site. You should be able to find an OSM map in the correct format that can be uploaded and displayed in either Basecamp or Mapsourse. They are designed for route planning and transferring data to and from your Garmin GPS. it may take a bit of time to get it working but once set-up it as the advantage that it can be used off line as well. You will find lots of information in the documentation on the OSM map page.   <br/>

But it has nothing to do with OSM ! Shouldnt it therefore be removed ?</p></div>
