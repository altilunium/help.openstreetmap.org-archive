<p>I have been using <code>highway=pedestrian area=yes</code> to draw a promenade area because that seemed like the semantically correct method for a wide pedestrian space, but now I'm wondering if that was a mistake? I'm fairly new to this so any advice would be very welcome. </p>

<p>I'm guessing this is the Brighton Bandstand at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/96655710">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/96655710</a>? (Full disclosure -- this building was a little jagged and I just uploaded a changeset to make it into a regular octogon.)</p>
<p><em>[Answer has been edited to reflect info from the comments below -- thanks <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/8189/alester"><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/8189/alester">@alester</a></a> <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/16887/kovoschiz"><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/16887/kovoschiz">@Kovoschiz</a></a> and <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/647/sk53"><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/647/sk53">@SK53</a></a> for the insights!]</em></p>
<p>For the bridge, I'd probably use a linear <code>highway=footway</code> + <code>bridge=yes</code> + <code>layer=1</code> without any area tags. I don't think it's necessary to map the exact extent of the bridge, but if I wanted to I'd add a separate polygon tagged with <code>man_made=bridge</code> and <code>layer=1</code>. If <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/8338/8186906204_0602cf87f7_b.jpg">this picture</a> is correct, it looks like there are steps leading up to the bridge, so I'd add a short way from the upper promenade to the <code>highway=footway</code> bridge and tag that with <code>highway=steps</code> + <code>incline=up</code> + <code>layer=1</code>. (You might even consider the steps part of the bridge, and if so they'd get the <code>bridge=yes</code> tag as well.)</p>
<p>I'd also use an octagonal linear footway to indicate the walking area around the bandstand, on the cafe roof. Mapping this as an area in addition or instead would also be possible, but I don't feel that it qualifies for <code>highway=pedestrian</code> since it doesn't appear suitable for any kind of emergency or delivery vehicular traffic.</p>
<p>As discussed in the comments below, it's possible to map a 2-D "foot area" as either <code>=footway</code> or <code>=pedestrian</code>, and one might well be more correct than the other in a particular situation, but <code>pedestrian</code> has long had a leg up (heh) because it's a programmed preset in iD.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there's a distinction between <strong>omnidirectional highway areas</strong> for mapping plazas and other situations where traffic can go anywhere and might enter and exit at a variety of locations, and <strong>linear highway areas</strong> for adding shape and width details to an already-mapped one-way or two-way linear highway. The omnidirectional areas should get two tags -- <code>highway=*</code> + <code>area=yes</code> -- and the linear areas should be drawn around the existing <code>highway=*</code> way and just be tagged <code>area:highway=*</code>. IMO either of these area methods could be used for the cafe roof, but neither is necessary. The area around the lower cafe level looks like omnidirectional pedestrian to me, and the bridge and upper promenade look like linear ways that could optionally be augmented with a separate <code>area:highway=*</code> way.</p>
<p>Whatever method you ultimately choose, take care that your upper and lower highways don't share any nodes, or routing software might send people jumping off the bandstand level to the cafe below instead of using the steps.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/20163/foomandoonian">@Foomandoonian</a> Ah sorry about that, my octagon compulsive disorder got the best of me. I didn't add or delete anything, just re-aligned the nodes, so it shouldn't be too much of a pain. It looks like you're mapping with iD, so you should just be able to select "Keep mine" (mine meaning yours) to overwrite my changes when you save.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/8189/alester">@alester</a> Yep that makes sense. Haven't seen it used much but scouting around on Overpass I see that it's actually more common than I thought. But highway=pedestrian still appears to be far more common. I think one reason is that polygonal footway areas are very often called "pedestrian areas" IRL, and another is that it's rare to find one that doesn't have <em>some</em> allowance for emergency or delivery traffic.</p></div>
