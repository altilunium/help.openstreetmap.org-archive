<p>This is a hard question to formulate to me, sorry for the long title... ):</p>
<p>I'm planning to map a town near me becouse has no buildings mapped, only road, so I downloaded a *.osm that cover the area to map, divided (for me) the area in small chunks and start editing, but today I came up with a doubt.</p>
<p>If someone changes something of the area that I downloaded, that I'm not going to edit, while I have the old local <em>.osm that I'm editing (which hasen't the edit that the other user has changed), his change will be reverted, becouse of my </em>.osm don't having the change?</p>
<p>I want to have this clear before uploading any "big" *.osm, to no revert any change other user would do. I don't know how to look for this in the Wiki, forum or anything. If this information is somewhere, please, tell me where.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>No, his change will <strong>not</strong> be reverted. If however, your edits touches some of the same objects, which he edited, you will encounter conflicts, which you will have to resolve before you can succesfully upload your changes.</p>

<p>If you try to upload a .osm file and others have made edits in that same area, that will create disagreement about which version is correct. In the JOSM editor, that disagreement is called a "conflict" and you will need to resolve it in favor of either your version or the other mapper's version before you will be allowed to upload your data. </p>
<p>JOSM will pop up a conflict editor window where the nodes in question are resolved one by one. This is a tedious process and in my experience best avoided if at all possible. If you must work offline, use small areas and upload your edits as often as you can to prevent these conflicts from occurring.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Are you sure about this? I think JOSM stores in the OSM file whether an object was changed or not, and only the changed and new objects are uploaded.</p>
<p>I tried to edit an OSM file directly some time ago, and then use JOSM to upload it, but because I didn't change the 'edited' qualifiers, JOSM refused to upload 'no changes'.</p>
<p>Of course, if the asker edited the same object as another used had edited in the meantime, you would indeed get an error, but for other objects, I suppose it will not bother with the existing data.</p></div>
