<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is it ok to map military exercises that take place offshore? The data is from NAVAREA that gives notices to seafarers and mariners to avoid certain areas during exercise. It is on the web, published weekly in open access. </p>
<p>Similarly, is it ok to map seismic surveys that are done by oil companies offshore? The data is also from NAVAREA. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>If something's happening for a short period of time (which I would imagine would apply to military exercises) then I personally wouldn't bother adding it to OSM, as it'll be irrelevant soon.  However, some people do map short-term stuff (and take care to remove it once the short-term event has passed).</p>
<p>If you were to add anything you'd need to check the licence.  You say "The data is from NAVAREA", but unfortately that doesn't translate into a set of licence terms that can be checked for compatibility with OSM.  Do you have a link?</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Yes, you are right it is temporarily. Perhaps I need to explain what we are trying to do (or thinking of doing). We are trying to map and track marine mammal strandings and anthropogenic noise activities (military, oil companies) worldwide. All these events are temporarily, like a dolphin stranded on this beach, and the oil survey that happened 100 km away from this beach. But we need to preserve these temporarily events for documentation and future analysis. Are there perhaps any similar projects that map temporarily stuff but keep it too? </p>
<p>We get location of live strandings from press articles, tweets, FB posts, etc as there is no systematic way to get data now. We get Navarea data from here: <a href="http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63">http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_63</a></p>
<p>it is published weekly and can be downloaded in kmz file.<br/>

<div class="comment-text"><p>It sounds like you could certainly use OpenStreetMap data (and maps made from OSM data), and could probably use a lot of the tools that people use to work with OSM data, but I think you'll need your own database to store the events that you're interested in.</p>
<p>Another project that sits alongside OSM but stores time-dependant information is <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Open_Historical_Map">Open Historical Map</a>.  You won't be able to use their database (your interested in very different timescales!) but it might be worth reaching out to them via their mailing list.</p>
<p>However, it may be that (because there aren't that many miltary exercises or dolphin strandings) you just want a generic "slippy map showing data displayed over the top of an OSM map", in which case one of the Leaflet** examples <a href="http://switch2osm.org/using-tiles/getting-started-with-leaflet/">here</a> and <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples.html">here</a> may help.</p>
<p>** Leaflet isn't part of the OSM project as such, but it is used by many people who wish to overlay data on top of OSM maps.</p></div>
