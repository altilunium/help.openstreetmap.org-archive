<p>I am recording a lot of tracks using OSMtracker. But I am still a beginner in OSMapping as such. A serious question I am facing now is what visibility to set for my uploaded tracks. I've read the corresponding <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Visibility_of_GPS_traces">wiki-page</a>, but I am quite confused and have additional questions. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Public is listed as a "historical" option. (Wouldn't it be a good idea to remove it all together?) So I am not using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifiable is a recommended option. However I feel really uneasy about someone knowing my name and when exactly and where I've been. I am pretty certain one could easily automate extraction of this information and, if I GPS a lot, re-build my whole life including my driving habits, whether I do jogging and even how often I visit a toilet while on city trips! :) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private is not preferred and I am not certain what useful information they contain. Can I see examples of private tracks somewhere?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trackable is the remaining option, and that's what I am using now. But I do not understand <em>exactly</em> what information they provide, so I would appreciate some more clarification. Again, can I get a list of trackable traces somewhere? <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/traces">http://www.openstreetmap.org/traces</a> only lists public traces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would think that the main useful information is the ordered list of track-points plus the POIs. This is what the wiki page states too. It is also useful to know when the track was recorded (how long ago as well as the time of the year/day). I also see the point in knowing <em>who</em> was in a particular area, to get in touch with questions. But it would be nice to be able to disconnect this information from specific tracks and time. <strong>Update:</strong> I actually wonder how often the ability to connect to the trace author is used in real world. Is it the only advantage of the identifiable trace in comparison to the trackable one?</p>
<p>The wiki page says something about getting the data via API. Obviously, it's too far for me yet. I just want to see all my and other users' tracks while editing the map (I am using iD and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vespucci">Vespucci</a> mainly). But are there maybe some online tools that implement the API and provide access to all the tracks?</p>

<p>I upload my traces using the identifiable tag, but only after i have cut out the following:-  ends that lead home, roads that already have a million traces, inside where signal get disrupted, any where i shouldn't have been, and birds nests( they are the tangle of traces record while stationary). To sum up  I like to see several traces for mapping a way  as it will indicate any off line traces especially in places where the route is narrow like a bridge or stile. Even a trusted gps will create a trace thats offset sometimes. So please let us all see your traces unless there are plenty there already. I use a paid for piece of software to edit my traces from Memory Map but you may find some free help at <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Edit_GPS_trac">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Edit_GPS_trac</a>   I have just installed GPSPrune which only took a couple of minutes, i already had JAVA installed, Prune dispayed the trace and with a another click OSM map layer. see <a href="http://activityworkshop.net/software/gpsprune/download.html">http://activityworkshop.net/software/gpsprune/download.html</a></p>

<p>Easiest way to access all uploaded GPS traces, is via the "OpenStreetMap GPS traces" option in iD. You can find this under the layer action. See <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/openstreetmap-gps-layer/">https://www.mapbox.com/blog/openstreetmap-gps-layer/</a> for some details.
The same layer is available in JOSM.</p>

<p>The closest to what I wanted to hear is the answer of @andy_mackey. He uploads <code>identifiable</code> tracks <em>after</em> manually removing all sensitive information from them. Which is quite a bit of work in my opinion. This helped me conclude that identifiable tracks as such are indeed a not so nice solution, unless you don't care at all or you track so occasionally that no patterns can be derived from your tracks. </p>
<p>In view of that, I will stick with the <code>trackable</code> mode until a better option appears. These tracks contain all the information needed to extract extra data (speed, exact time of year/day, text notes) but do not disclose the author's personality.</p>
