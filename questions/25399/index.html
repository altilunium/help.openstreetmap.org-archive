<p>At the risk of duplicating information in existing answers, here's my take.</p>
<p>The major hint is in the name Scenic <strong>Route</strong>, which suggests consulting <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Route">route</a> on the wiki, also the relevant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_routes">wikipedia</a> page is useful.</p>
<p>I generally use a similar approach to that of <code>he_the_great</code>, but look for a well-known feature which is similar on OpenStreetMap. The candidates I chose for a scenic route were : the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_Road">Romantic Road</a>, the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Alpenstra%C3%9Fe">German Alpine Road</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Parkway">Blue Ridge Parkway</a>. In France there are many Routes du Vin, but I'm not so familiar with them, whereas I have driven on my three main candidates.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/56917">Romantic Road</a> is mapped with a relation route=road and tourism=yes tags. </li>
<li>The Alpine road does not appear to be mapped.</li>
<li><a href="http://osm.org/go/ZT6pnm3m--">Blue Ridge Parkway and Skyline Drive</a> are mapped but not using a relation because they were actually built and named as single entities. Route relations would enable all the separate ways sharing the name to be accessed together and information such as their membership of the National Park System to be noted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Searching the OSM Wiki for <code>Romantische Strasse</code> links to a page on <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Germany/Ferienstra%C3%9Fen">Tourist Routes</a> (Ferienstrasse) for Germany. This contains a list of such routes, how much of a route has been mapped, and advice on mapping such routes including recommended tags. (It is always a good idea to check if something has been mapped in Germany because of the larger size of the mapping community).</p>
<p>There is another type of scenic road, notably indicated on Michelin maps, but this depends entirely on subjective judgement and is therefore not suitable for mapping on OSM. This is a good job as many sections of so-called scenic routes are in my, subjective, opinion not very scenic.</p>
<p>So in summary. Start looking for something specific which is similar to what you want to map either using a search engine or directly on OSM. Once you find something you are likely to discover that someone else has already mapped something, and that there may be a reasonable amount of documentation. Don't believe people who talk about the 'powers that be', as they clearly are poorly informed.</p>

<p>I could code this in our "Touring view" map style, that would be the perfect place for that.</p>
<p>But if there is no OSM tag, I guess we are bust ... :-(

<p>Indeed Hardy,</p>
<p>Very nice idea, make me think about the old Michelin maps!.
But if it is not in the osm data (as a tag ) nothing can be done by Osmand. So it has to be posted on Osm discussion group (s) (again), hoping a few crazy old men driving in 60 years old cabriolets and having a lot of spare time pick up the idea!</p>

<p>The issue for the user is not whether there is a tag for scenic roads but whether OSM can render them differently from other types of roads, so as a user I can clearly see where such roads are. IN the US, there is a list of state and federal roads designated as scenic routes, so these would not be subject to personal interpretation.</p>
<p>It seems that OSM does not have the capability to graphically distinguish such roads.</p></div>

<p>I can locate the link about the "crazy men in their 60s" but I think it just diverts the discussion from the real issues, among them whether OSM can graphically distinguish scenic routes from other types of roads. If it cannot, it is a major omission and drawback.</p></div>

<p>If you have an example of your rendering of a scenic route, I would be happy to examine it and adopt your approach. As can be seen from the above comments, there is a tag to use highway= scenic</p>
<p>QUESTION: Can OSM render this type of road (i.e highway=scenic) differently (in color, graphic, etc.)?</p></div>

<p>My general approach for find how to tag something has been to google: osm [thing I want to do]</p>
<p>In this case: osm scenic route</p>
<p>I've found a page on <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:scenic">key:scenic</a> which appears to be what you want. I also found a mapping of <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/1281678">Northern Scenic Route</a>. You likely can use the tag on relations if the route travels several roads.</p>
<p>However I don't know of software that could show such routes.</p>

<p>You could have a look at <a href="https://kurviger.de/en">Kurviger</a> which generates scenic motorcycle routes, which can be also used by car. Kurviger avoids cities and highways, while preferring curves and slopes, which will result in a pretty scenic drive.
