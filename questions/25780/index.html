<p>I try to map a disrupted postcode area to an area that also matches landuse="residential". I thought I'd use the <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Catalogue/Postleitzahlen_Deutschland_2010">German approach with multipolygon</a>   ...</p>
<p>The village lies in Luxemburg near the German border. I couldn't find any advice on how the Luxemburgish mapping community addresses postal_code, but Nomanitim doesn't return any result for Luxemburgish Postcodes so far, although the mappers applied postal_code to streets directly (never saw that before). So I think it should be solved differently.</p>
<p>I try to describe it in a very simple way: suppose we have 2 postcodes A and B in village X. </p>
<p>They are "stacked" like this, with A being the old center of the village</p>
<pre><code>B
 A
B
</code></pre>
<p>BAB prefectly matches the landuse="residential" area.</p>
<p><img alt="disrupted postcode area" src="http://help.openstreetmap.org/upfiles/disrupted-postcode-areas.png"/></p>
<p>Is it OK to have at the end 3 mutlipolygons sharing the common ways, all components specified as "outer"?</p>
<ol>
<li>village X </li>
<li>postocde area A</li>
<li>postcode area B made up of 1 single multipolygon, but defining 2
    closed areas</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for your advice,
Georges</p>

<p>Yes, you solution sounds good!</p>
<p>There are a bunch of such separated areas with the same postal_code in Germany, too.</p>
<p>If you have done your edit, give us a permalink to that town, then we can inspect the relations.</p>
<p>There are also some ways to visualize boundary areas mapped as relations, there you can even detect logical errors in boundary elements.</p>
<p>More to come ...</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I was almost sure that my approach must be OK, so I uploaded the data already yesterday. And Nomanitim shows exactly the result I was expecting (hoping) to see with "lenningen 5431". "5430" is the other postcode.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?relation=3163883#map=16/49.6011/6.3658">http://www.openstreetmap.org/?relation=3163883#map=16/49.6011/6.3658</a></p>
<p>But to which extend is this applicable? I had already to guide one border through connected buildings (left near the church). But there is apparently another building in the north of the village lying in a second row of postcode 5431 but belonging to 5430. Should I really draw an island area with role=inner for multipolygon 5431 and role=outer for multiploygon 5430. Isn't that overkill for one building?</p>
<p>In Luxemburg you have 4 digits postcodes with round about 500 localities. You can imagine that often a postcode only covers a couple of streets. Sometimes you can barely call them areas. If you have just 2-5 streets covered by a postcode, a simple postcode relation tying these streets together would be much simpler. </p>
<p>But I'm afraid of the many different algorithms client software have to provide to analyze all the concurrent strategies to organize hierarchical data.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Hmmm, comparing to postal_code system in Germany, maybe it is too easy to draw a boundary around a bunch of streets and houses, and to define by this "little" area that this the area with postal_code=xxxx</p>
<p>Only for a general compare: is there an official map online where we can see the system of postal_code areas in Luxembourg?</p>
<p>If you can speak German a little bit, then I invite you to the german section at <a href="http://forum.openstreetmap.org">http://forum.openstreetmap.org</a> ... there we have a quite recent topic about the correctness of postal_code areas in Germany.</p></div>
