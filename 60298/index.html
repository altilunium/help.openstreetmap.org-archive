<p>I have a problem with the mall that I have fiddled with in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/53202753#map=18/57.04728/9.92735">this changeset</a>.
The problem is that the two building parts 370434881 and 370434882 cross a road. They are first-floor parts of the mall where the road passes under. You can see them in for example this picture:<img alt="alt text" src="https://migogaalborg.dk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Friis-edit.jpg"/></p>
<p>I suppose I could try tagging them like the nearby passage through the building part 370411677, but I think of these parts of the mall as less of a tunnel through a building than smaller building parts crossing the road.</p>
<p>I have currently tried tagging the building parts as <code>level=1</code> and the the parts of the road beneath them as <code>covered=yes</code>. This usually works for roofs over gas stations etc., but in this case here, the road parts are not rendered as covered by the building. I suspect this is because the building parts are members of the larger mall multipolygon 441887338 which is tagged as a building and is implicitly layer 0?</p>
<p>How would you suggest tagging this situation to get the road correctly rendered as covered by the buildings?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is not the question you should be asking. Instead, you should be asking a question like, "How would you suggest tagging this situation to best represent the reality on-the-ground?" The rendering will vary depending on the data consumer, so don't worry about that part. Just make sure the objects are tagged as accurately as you can.</p>
<p>As for how I would tag it, I would tag the building part as layer=1 (because it physically crosses above the implicit layer=0 highway) and the highway underneath as covered=yes. At the time of my writing this, it appears that this is how these objects are already tagged, so I don't see any reason to change anything. The "Standard" rendering at osm.org renders highways differently when tagged with covered=yes, so there's already an indication that a portion of the highway is covered.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I guess my question here is then: Should the mall be represented by a multipolygon (as it is now)? The entire multipolygon is implicitly <code>layer=0</code>, but that does not accurately reflect the two building parts crossing the road which are individually tagged <code>layer=1</code>.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Yes, the mall should be represented as a multipolygon because it has a hole.</p>
<p>The way <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/370434882">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/370434882</a> is tagged with building:part=yes and layer=1.  As far as I understand the building:part spec that's the correct tagging: the building part is a separate way that overlaps the base building (which, in this case, happens to be a multipolygon).</p></div>
