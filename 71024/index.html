<p>I'm trying to map a residential apartment complex close to me that has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a closed area with two addresses/entrances</li>
<li>Inside this area there are two independent buildings of different heights. Each one has a name just so you can say "it's on building A" but are otherwise referenced by the street address of the complex itself</li>
<li>Has a pool in the area</li>
</ul>
<p>The complex looks roughly like this:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="https://help.openstreetmap.org/upfiles/pngout.png"/></p>
<p>My issue is that I found a few posts with instructions on how to map things similar to this, but some were a bit old and seemed to offer conclicting advice. Some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of area should the outline be? <code>landuse=residential</code>, <code>type=site</code>, <code>building=apartments</code>? What about the multiple entrance/addresses? What kinds of elements are they and what tags should I apply?</li>
<li>Should the buildings themselves be areas with <code>building=apartments</code> tags?</li>
<li>How do I/should I link each of these parts with relations to show that they're part of the same complex?</li>
</ul>

<p>The two buildings should be building=apartments, yes.</p>
<p>What do you do if you want to send a letter to the residents in either building? What address would you use? I'd put that address also on the building polygons: addr:country, addr:city, addr:postcode, addr:street and addr:housenumber. You can put a ref=A and ref=B on the buildings if there is such simple name. Or name=Building A if it is a more elaborate name, for example West Tower.</p>
<p>The addresses can also be put onto an otherwise empty node at the complex entrances, especially if one of the addresses is not already on one of the buildings.</p>
<p>Usually, the whole surrounding area should have landuse=residential not only this apartment complex (unless of course it is alone inside another type of landuse). If you want to show this complex belongs together you could still use a dedicated landuse=residential for this complex, especially if it has a common name, other than the address ("I live in the South Park Residences."). If the whole complex is fenced you could also map the fence and the gates.</p>
<p>The type=site is only used on relations. I probably wouldn't use a site relation here, since everything is grouped together and not dispersed over a wider area.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Note that there are some regional differences for the address information, typically in Belgium you do not put the country, city not postcode on the address-nodes/buildings.
In The Netherlands and Denmark, addresses have to be mapped as points. I believe the same is true for Italy, where addresses belong to doors.</p></div>

<p>What address would you use?</p>

<p>You can use either one and add in the necessary apt number and building as both buildings can have an apartment with the same number, e.g. "123 One Street/Apt 222 building B"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>empty node</p>

<p>To clarify, an empty node is a point in the editor?</p></div>
