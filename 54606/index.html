<p>I can't speak for all of America's Bing imagery, but in Pennsylvania, the imagery is often horribly outdated (5-6+ years old). I've often tried to use USGS Large Scale Imagery, but most of the time it's so slow that it's unusable, or will just load a handful of tiles and just quit working. (This seems to be a server-side issue.)</p>
<p>So I tried to add the 2015 NAIP imagery for Pennsylvania, using the tutorial <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/National_Agriculture_Imagery_Program">here</a> for the WMS format. I went to <a href="https://gis.apfo.usda.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAIP">this page</a>, clicked on the <a href="https://gis.apfo.usda.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAIP/Pennsylvania_2015_1m/ImageServer">Pennsylvania link</a>, and selected WMS at the top left to be taken <a href="https://gis.apfo.usda.gov/arcgis/services/NAIP/Pennsylvania_2015_1m/ImageServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&amp;service=WMS">here</a>. I then took that URL and followed the directions in JOSM, clicking "Get Layers", selecting "Pennsylvania_2015_1m", and selecting "image/jpeg" as the image format.</p>
<p>After clicking OK on the popup and the Imagery preferences window, I went to add the imagery layer. However, I got a popup about some kind of wrong projection:</p>
<pre><code>The layer gis.apfo.usda.gov: Pennsylvania_2015_1m does not support the new projection EPSG:3857. Supported projections are: CRS:84, EPSG:0, EPSG:4326.
JOSM will use EPSG:4326 to query the server, but results may vary depending on the WMS server
Change the projection again or remove the layer.
</code></pre>
<p>After clicking OK to enable the layer anyway, nothing apparent happens. When I zoom all the way out to view the entire world, the right half of the world is black-covered, with what seems to be three tiles appearing to the right of the edge of the world, only appearing as the red error "Error: Could not load image from tile server". At first I thought maybe the offset was just way wrong or something, but zooming in at various places does nothing.</p>
<p>What is going on with this, and why do I get this error despite following the instructions to the letter, with no mention at all of the possibility of this error? How can I make this imagery work in JOSM?</p>
<p>EDIT 1: See comment of mine below...</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I don't have any suggestion for debugging the issue, but I've just checked that the layer does work. Just today I published an attempt to make it easier to add the NAIP layers: <a href="https://maxerickson.github.io/NAIP_Remote/">https://maxerickson.github.io/NAIP_Remote/</a></p>
<p>But it's only really easier if the JOSM remote control is already setup.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>That link got me a little farther than I was before. It added a layer that looked exactly like the weird half black, half off-the-world layer I got before, but occasionally while zoomed out I could see the image of Pennsylvania that would flicker on my screen as i panned around. Zooming in would render nothing at that location.</p>
<p>Curiously, this only happens in the option you linked to, maxerickson. Using the straight link from the OP, there's no Pennsylvania visible at all.</p>
<p>EDIT: See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmNy6HJFZWQ">here</a> for a video demonstration of the problem. (If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video must be worth a million.) This is right after clicking the link in that page, which adds the layer.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Occasionally the NAIP server is just down for me.   Now I get the same error as you do above, but was able to get actual imagery which looks reasonably well aligned to Bing.   I looked in PA randomly near Blairsville and Pittsburgh.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>As of today it's still misaligned and doesn't appear when zoomed in. However, I asked on the josm-dev mailing list, and someone pointed me to the following TMS link for the nationwide NAIP layer:</p>
<p>tms:http://{switch:a,b,c}.tile.openstreetmap.us/usgs_naip/{zoom}/{x}/{y}.jpg</p>
<p>This works fine when added with a high enough max zoom level, and is far more recent than Bing.</p></div>
