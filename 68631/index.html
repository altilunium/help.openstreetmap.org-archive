<p>I am working on importing a number of ways obtained as a result of vectorizing of a raster map. Because of the nature of the source data and as a result of chosen curve smoothing algorithm there are many cases when a single way intersects itself. In general, self-intersection has no automatic resolution in e.g. JOSM and requires human intervention, which in my case would be many hundreds of edits.</p>
<p>However, in my case it is always a very specific type of self-intersection that should rather be described as a "self-touching way". Let me illustrate it.</p>
<p><img alt="intersection" src="https://help.openstreetmap.org/upfiles/self-touching.JPG"/></p>
<p>On the image above pay attention that there is a node an the intersection point, at direction of individual segments make it so that the right part of the "eight"-like figure touches the left part of it in that point. So it is not two duplicate notes (different IDs but same coordinates) but rather a single node (the same ID) that is present two times in a same way. Inspecting the OSM XML confirms this observation.</p>
<p>An algorithmic solution that is possible in this case is to remove one occurrence of that repeating node from the way. The result of such transformation for my example is below:</p>
<p><img alt="split" src="https://help.openstreetmap.org/upfiles/split.JPG"/></p>
<p>This transformation reaches the goal of preserving a "waistline" in the eight-shaped polygon, only making it slightly "thicker". This is an acceptable approximation given the resolution of the original raster data and noise already present in it.</p>
<p>The same effect can be achieved manually: a) duplicate the node, b) delete one of the copied nodes.</p>
<p>Such a solution is fine for my application and is guaranteed to create no new self-intersections because of the way the polygon is oriented (orientation of the top circle and the bottom circle always match).</p>
<p>I can come up with a solution that involves scripted editing of the underlying OSM-XML (see my own answer below). But I wonder <strong>if there are solutions to do it automatically without the need to export to OSM format, e.g. directly in the JOSM editor.</strong></p>
<p><em>P.S.</em> An alternative solution is to create two independent ways touching each other at the central node (upper circle and a lower circle). It is a bit harder to do when editing an XML in a sense that new ways have to be allocated, but is also acceptable for me if there are ready tools to do that.</p>

<p>My own solution so far is to export the JOSM layer into an OSM XML file. Then to use a scripted language capable of processing XML (Python or any other really) to open the file and do the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>For each way check if there are repeating node IDs ("ref" tag) included into it.</li>
<li>If there are such repetitions, keep only one of them</li>
<li>Make an exception for the first and the last node reference in the way. For closed ways their IDs are the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I mentioned already, applying such script requires exporting data from JOSM, processing it and then 
reopening it in JOSM for further processing and uploading to the database.</p>
