<p>There is a road near my house that is a very minor route, not maintained by the local council, that is mostly used for access to houses. It can be divided into 3 distinct sections:
North: This section is paved, easily passable and has several driveways connecting to it. 
Centre: This section has a dirt surface and would likely be difficult to drive in an ordinary car, although definitely passable on foot, on a bike or in a tractor, and probably reasonably easy to drive in an SUV.
South: This section has a gravel surface but is still easily passable by most vehicles. Also has driveways connecting to it. </p>
<p>What is the correct way to tag this road as? Should it be tagged as one road, or should each section have a different classification?</p>

<p>Firstly, based on what you've said, each section should have a different classification, as there will be different tags needed on the different sections.</p>
<p>It sounds as if each section might be "highway=service" or perhaps even "highway=residential" - have a look at how other similar roads are mapped in your country.  Also make sure that the "access" tags are correct - this will also vary depending on what country you are in.</p>
<p>For the northern section, use an appropriate "paved" surface tag - see <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/surface#values">taginfo</a> for a list.  Perhaps also add a <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/smoothness#values">smoothness</a> tag - see <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key%3Asmoothness">here</a> for a description of those.</p>
<p>For the middle and southern sections, use an appropriate "unpaved" surface tag and perhaps also a smoothness tag.  Also consider a <a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/tracktype#values">tracktype</a> value between grade1 and grade5 (see <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key%3Atracktype">here</a> for more information).</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>This definitely doesn't sound like unclassified (which would normally be a council-maintained road). The N &amp; S sections sound very much like service roads (shared driveways) &amp; the middle section either a much degraded service road or track. Using track would strongly discourage routers from sending people along the whole route. I wouldn't worry too much about the precise value of service or track, the other tags mentioned by SomeoneElse are probably more useful.</p></div>
