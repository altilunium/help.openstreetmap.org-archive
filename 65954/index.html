<p>I know that iD editor is not too useful working with relations, so I usually don't do anything with them, as that is the editor I use at the moment.</p>
<p>But there has been several occasions where I'm not sure if I'm doing it right when I need to edit ways that are members of relation. Maybe there is a better, more correct way?</p>
<p>So, say there is an intersection of streets and it has recently been made into a roundabout. I make a circular way for the roundabout and then go splitting and disconnecting the streets involved, but then I can't because they turn out to be members of a bus route relation.
The only way how I can see I can do this in iD is splitting a segment off the way, then removing that segment out of the relation and then deleting the segment altogether.</p>
<p>Is there another way?</p>

<p>Hi, yes you have to split/remove the ways as you outlined in your last sentence. You then have to split the roundabout and add a section of the roundabout to the relevant route relation. So the bus route goes to the roundabout, around part of it then carries on along the next highway.</p>
<p>I use JOSM so can't give relation editing advice for the iD editor.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I did add the roundabout to the same relations the street was on but I did not split it. I've checked other roundabouts that are in bus route relations in the area I'm mapping and none of them are split either.
Is there a benefit of doing that?
I personally don't like splitting ways too much if there is no real need for it</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>My apologies, indeed we are both correct. It appears from <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:route#Bus_routes_and_roundabouts">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:route#Bus_routes_and_roundabouts</a>
that both ways are accepted. But if the roundabout is not split then in some circumstances software has to deduce the actual route.</p>
<p>My logical mind would still prefer to section up roundabouts especially when separate link roads are leading to the roundabout. On the roundabout Way: 496095881, Relation: Pegasus - Kaiapoi (1625409) and    Relation: Kaiapoi - Waikuku (1625408) do not use the whole circle of the roundabout. Another example that comes to mind is when a route takes the first of multiple exits from a roundabout, then only a fraction of the roundabout is used in the actual route. </p></div>
