<p>I am aware of at least a couple of neighborhoods where the boundary between them has changed during the years. In this case, because a road has became central dividing the old neighborhood, leaving some blocks adjacent to the next neighborhood. Current descriptions of the neighborhoods in newspaper and magazine articles verify the current boundaries as they have evolved. But the cadastre still has this small number of blocks listed as belonging to the next neighborhood. </p>
<p>What is important here? Culturaly both neighborhoods are well defined with a central road between them (currently a secondary road couple with two lanes in each direction). Locals use that definition. They are also defined in cadastre with the boundary being a residential road inside the adjacent neighborhood. Notaries and government use the older borders (for legal continuity).</p>
<p>What should I prefer? Local cultural definition, or state definition?</p>
