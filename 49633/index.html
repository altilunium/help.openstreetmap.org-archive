<p>I'm working on a project involving historical data, which I'm wanting to turn into an .osm XML file as a routable network (e.g. using OSRM) and for rendering (using Mapnik/CartoCSS). The data will <strong>not</strong> be added into OSM.</p>
<p>My aim is to convert the Shapefiles into .osm format, and be routable, so that I then get the benefits of the OSM toolsets.</p>
<p>I'm very familiar with OSM and its ecosystem, being a long-time contributor and user. What I'm not so familiar is the GIS world, where a Shapefile (in my case from ArcGIS) has to contain ways and nodes as separate layers.</p>
<p>The main problem I'm having is making the network actually topographically routable.</p>
<p><strong>Can anyone suggest a workflow which would enable the two layers containing lines and junction points to be merged into a single .osm file where the points become nodes actually as properties of the ways?</strong></p>
<p>Currently I am:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking the Shapefiles from ArcGIS; there are two shapefiles, one with the lines (for the ways) and one for connected junctions</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/vectormap2garmin/wiki/ogr2osm/">ogr2osm.py</a> to convert from *.shp to .osm (in WGS84)</li>
<li>Then using Osmosis to transform the tags to OSM standards (e.g. <code>waterway=river</code>)</li>
<li>Then using Osmosis to merge the layers, using <code>osmosis --rx Edges.osm --sort --rx Junctions.osm --sort --merge --wx merged.osm</code></li>
<li>Building with OSRM as a proof of routability</li>
<li>Rendering in Mapnik as a proof of data presence. This does confirm that the network is all present and in the right projection.</li>
</ul>
<p>The routability partly works - stretches of route do route, but where there are junctions, the routability stops.</p>
<p>My clear hunch is that the .osm data contains all the ways and nodes but that the ways themselves do not reference the nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Is there some adjustment or different toolchain I could use the merge the two layers properly rather than treat them as two sets of items in the one .osm file?</strong> I'm trying to avoid having to pick through and modify XML directly, which will not fun.</p>
<p>Any pointers would be appreciated.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Can you elaborate on the role of the "points" shape file. Since the "lines" file will already contain geometries for each road, and could be turned into a routable file by unrolling these geometries into OSM ways and nodes, what purpose does the "points" file have?</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>The points file was created to have the actual junctions in, as distinct from places where the lines simply cross over (e.g. a bridge). However, I will check on whether this is actually needed. I think we previously tried just the lines file and that didn't give us a properly-routable network.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Seems this has worked. Thanks again, Frederik. Turns out the main issue was that I'd chosen highway=motorway in the Osmosis tag conversion, resulting in lots of implied one ways in the router.</p></div>
