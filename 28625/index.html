<p>Hello,
I have noticed that searching for an place that has an address outside of the actual city (admin boundary) will not show up in Nominatim. I know that you can add an addr:city tag to the road the place is located on to correct this. But that would mean that every single road outside of the city would have to be tagged with addr:city for it to appear. Is there a way to automatically add that tag to every road outside of the city without having to add it to every single road?</p>
<p>For example, in the town of Glen Rock, PA (rural town) most of the roads are not in the actual polygon for the town. If you search for a road outside of Glen Rock by typing in Example Road glen rock pa, the road will not be found. With a lot of rural roads, adding addr:city to every road would be very time consuming. Is their any automatic tagging for such roads?</p>

<p>Your question corresponds IMHO to the following single problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Wrong place association in Nominatim</strong><br/>
As you already described, geocoding from OSM data relies on a 2 step preprocessing to normalize the data. First they filter all address objects and then they try to expand them to full 'global addresses' using hierarchies (boundary polygones or surrounding areas around place nodes).<br/>
This process is fragile, as polygones can be broken or have a unexpected classification, or can have wrong (here: not the official) geometry.<br/>
I was sadly unable to find your example, but if the road doesn't touch the official town border, then the border of the town might just be wrong?<br/>
On the other hand, you might use <strong>nominatims "near" operator</strong> to find a road that is close to a spec. city like "my road near Glen Rock, PA".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>use addr: tag fixes:</strong><br/>
Corresponding to the wiki, the addr: key is only used for buildings or POIs?<br/>
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:addr</a><br/>
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Karlsruhe_Schema">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Karlsruhe_Schema</a><br/>
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Addresses">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Addresses</a><br/>
I only know <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:postal_code">postal_code=*</a> that is tagged to the streets directly. So for me this sounds a bit like <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Best_practices#Don.27t_map_for_the_renderer">'tagging for renderer'</a> (here: geocoder) to fix specific misbehavior of a product and that should avoided. So we need to discuss to find the technical reasons and <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits">avoid mechanical edits</a>. Please hop in the forums or the mailinglists :)</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Your answer presumes that all roads associated with a town are within the borders of that town, which may be true in some jurisdictions but is emphatically <em>not</em> true in much of the US (and Ireland, apparently).  This is not a question of tagging for the renderer.  See my other question ( <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/19407/how-to-make-post-office-town-available-to-nominatim">https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/19407/how-to-make-post-office-town-available-to-nominatim</a> ) for more details of the situation.  The specific advice there was to use addr:city on the streets.</p></div>

<p>You are <strong>confusing administrative entities and settlements</strong>.</p>
<p>You can have a place-polygon (or multipolygon) for the settlement and another one for the administrative entity.</p>
<p>It is not unusual that the two are not the same. Personally I'd use the place polygon on the built-up space belonging (according to who lives there) to the settlement, while the administrative entities (boundary=administrative, admin_level=x) are those as authoritively defined.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I'm not sure that's actually the problem here; it's more that there are two different administrative entities.  The named built-up space (to which you would assign the place polygon) may correspond to either, both, or neither of the main administrative entities.  To use an example close to where I live, there <em>are</em> people who are outside the official town limits of Farmville but generally say they live "in Farmville"; but there are also people who live well outside of town but whose mailing address (and address to look up on maps) is "in" Farmville.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>blahedo, I don't think there are two different <em>administrative</em> entities. There is one: the municipality and its boundary. The second thing you're referring to is the postal address, which is based on what the postal service determines is the zip code and preferred mailing city for that address. You're talking about ways to add that data to OSM, but it doesn't really fit very well. That's one reason why Nominatim uses some non-OSM data. The place=* (settlement) tags sometimes are coincident to the admin tags, but sometimes offer an alternative to them.</p></div>
