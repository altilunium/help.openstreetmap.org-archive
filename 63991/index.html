<p>Hi
I've been updating some UK railway stations, &amp; was reading up on <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:public_transport%3Dstop_area">Stop Area</a></p>
<p>What benefit is there in having what appears to be quite random items (bike parking, cafes etc) in a <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/4713070#map=17/51.26848/-1.08883">relation</a>? I thought creating relations as a 'collection of things' was discouraged.</p>
<p>To me, all the relevant tags to indicate where a transport stop is are much easily accessible in a node on the highway/railway, or am I missing something?</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>To be honest, the current public transport scheme seems very complicated to me: you need to make a route relation for each direction (gathering ways + stops + platforms), another mega-relation (type=route_master) for the whole, and here I'm seeing that for each stop area you need to gather elements in a relation too, right? That being said, editing relations is often frustrating and time taking.</p></div>

<p>I'm iffy on the idea of amenities as members of a <code>public_transport=stop_area</code> relation. If the cafe or bicycle parking is available to the general public even when they're not currently using the transport in question, it's an unhelpful confusion to map it as part of the transport relation.</p>
<p>I see that the wiki (currently) disagrees and mentions in particular <code>taxi</code> and <code>bicycle_parking</code> as suggested relation members. Offhand I can't picture a station design where these amenities would be restricted to transport users. Maybe at a ferry or airport?</p>
<p>Some metro stations do include a cafe or fast food or vending machine or atm... I can see the case for these being part of the transport relation -- <strong><em>if</em></strong> they're located in an area only accessible to those who've paid a fare. I think tagging these with <code>access=customers</code> would also be appropriate, or maybe invent something more explicit like <code>access=transport_customers</code>.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Yeah I've been waiting for that to shake out. Until then I haven't been doing any public transport in my area, which is currently tagged up a dozen different ways and desperately needs some sanity.</p>
<p>When the dust settles, then we can ponder about what scheme is best to indicate that certain amenities are for ticketed passengers only. In general, I feel that jamming them into transport relations is an awkward approach.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/8569/nakaner">@Nakaner</a>, meta responses about cross-posting as first line of an answer are not very helpful for users here. <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/4225/dave">@Dave</a> F is quite right in that many more people will see answers here than in talk-transit, therefore a complaint about cross-posting as the first response is not appropriate. Please use comments only to highlight cross-posting (which is useful as it can save someone the effort of writing a reply when the question has already been answered). I have therefore moved it to the end of your reply.</p></div>
