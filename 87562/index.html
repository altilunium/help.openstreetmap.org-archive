<p>I'm trying to fix the location of "11008 NE 68th St, Kirkland, WA 98033". The first two entries in the search results look more or less correct. The first "House" result is specifically for unit 720 which is odd, but at least it's in the right building. The "Building" result is correct albeit shifted east relative to the satellite imagery like all the other buildings in the area. The roads don't seem to have the same eastward shift. (Note: I'm not personally too concerned about this eastward shift, and I'm certainly not going to edit all the buildings manually one-by-one, but this might be something for someone else who knows how to bulk edit to look into.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the third search entry which is also called "House 11008, Northeast 68th Street, Kirkland, King County, Washington, 98033, United States" exactly like the first entry links to a segment of the NE 68th St "secondary highway" far away from the building.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=11008%20NE%2068th%20St%2C%20Kirkland%2C%20WA%2098033">https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=11008%20NE%2068th%20St%2C%20Kirkland%2C%20WA%2098033</a>
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/428069119">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/428069119</a></p>
<p>I've noticed that other addresses in the same complex have the same issue. For example, at addresses 11010 and 11112:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=11010%20NE%2068th%20St%2C%20Kirkland%2C%20WA%2098033">https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=11010%20NE%2068th%20St%2C%20Kirkland%2C%20WA%2098033</a>
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=11112%20NE%2068th%20St%2C%20Kirkland%2C%20WA%2098033">https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=11112%20NE%2068th%20St%2C%20Kirkland%2C%20WA%2098033</a></p>
<p>Not all of them though. Address 11206 for example only has search results that point to the correct building and not the main road as it should.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=11206%20NE%2068th%20St%2C%20Kirkland%2C%20WA%2098033">https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=11206%20NE%2068th%20St%2C%20Kirkland%2C%20WA%2098033</a></p>
<p>I tried creating an account and deleting the incorrect entry pointing to the main road, but I cannot find what's causing this "secondary highway" to show up as "House 11008, Northeast 68th Street, Kirkland, King County, Washington, 98033, United States" in the search results. <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/428069119">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/428069119</a> has no obvious references to "11008". How do I delete it?</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Both building 11206 (which has 2 search results both pointing directly to the building) and building 11008 (which has the incorrect 3rd search result pointing far away on the street) have their addr:street tag set to "Northeast 68th Street", so this cannot be it. You can follow the search links in my question to see what I'm talking about. There's nothing that jumps out as me as different, but there must be something.</p></div>
