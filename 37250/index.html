<p>While mapping, I've recently come across roads that are very likely not to exist, at least when comparing their course to Bing (and other) satellite imagery.</p>
<p>For example, I saw a road that, according to Bing, ended at a specific point. However, in OSM it was mapped as continuing after that point and it was even shown as being connected to another road. According to Bing and other satellite layers, it looked like there could not even be a path where this road was mapped.</p>
<p>So, is it suitable to remove the road where it probably doesn't exist, even though I'm not a local mapper and cannot verify this 100%? </p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Please do add a OSM URL to one of the places in question. If it is the United States, especially if it is in the rural western United States, it may be one of the old Tiger data imports which are notoriously inaccurate and definitely need to be cleaned up. If you are using JOSM there is a Tiger 2013 overlay which is generally better and can assist in cleaning up. But even that is far from perfect. It could be that ID and/or Potlatch have that image overlay too but I don't use them so I can't say.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>As I am relatively new to OSM, I sadly don't know how to get a link to those roads. The concerned objects where "Krasnyj per." (Красный пер.) and a nameless road next to it, in the village of Parkany (Парканы) in Transnistria/Moldova. Sadly I don't know any local <i>mappers</i>, I know a person that lives there and that confirmed to me that both roads were mapped incorrectly. I have corrected this since then.</p>
<p>Whenever I stumble across such problems again, I will just leave a note, except for the rare cases where I have a local source. Thanks for the tips.</p></div>

<p>The only way to be <em>really</em> sure is to go and have a look, so personally I'd add a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Note">note</a> suggesting that there might be a problem so that a local mapper can investigate.  It's fairly easy to get OSM notes local to an area (so easy that even I <a href="https://github.com/SomeoneElseOSM/Notes01">wrote something</a> to do that), and local mappers can see and act on them.</p>
<p>As an alternative, perhaps find the main communications mechanisms that the local community uses (which might be <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contact">mailing lists, forum, IRC or something else</a>) and ask there?  Someone may be able to give you an answer straight away.</p>
