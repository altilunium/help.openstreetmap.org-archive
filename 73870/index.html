<p>Hi there. Thank you for your help in advance!</p>
<p>I am new to setting up my own OSM Tile Server. I followed the instructions here: <a href="https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-18-04-lts/">https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-18-04-lts/</a></p>
<p>Question: My question is how to determine if osm2pgsql has finished successfully while running the command in the background?</p>
<p>Note: This is related to importing the Planet OSM file (more details below). The test import of Azerbaijan detailed in the setup instructions did work as documented, so I know the basic setup is working.</p>
<p>I reviewed the "/var/log/syslog" file and I don't see any messages "success" related to "osm". However, several times when the import failed, there were messages related to the failure - mainly that osm2pgsql had been killed.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest how I can validate that osm2pgsql did indeed finish successfully? Or is there another place I should be looking for logs?</p>
<p>More Details (in case these help):</p>
<p>I was able to get the basic server running and did the test included in the instructions and confirmed that the software was running properly.</p>
<p>I then imported the Planet OSM file. This required several attempts and tweaks and I referred to multiple helpful pages and posts on the web.</p>
<p>I "think" I was finally successful in importing the Planet OSM file with the following command:
sudo -u ubuntu osm2pgsql -d gis --create --slim --flat-nodes 'nodes.bin' --cache-strategy dense -G --hstore --tag-transform-script ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.lua -S ~/src/openstreetmap-carto/openstreetmap-carto.style ~/data/planet-latest.osm.pbf &gt;out.txt 2&gt;/dev/null &amp;</p>
<p>My machine is an AWS EC2 m5.2xlarge instance (8 vCPUs and 32 GB RAM) with a 1.3 TB Disk - EBS Volume).</p>
<p>I think peak disk usage reached about 1.2 TB and it took 3 days to run.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>If anything is going to run for a while, I tend to use "screen" and detach (using ^a^d) from it while doing something else.  Then "screen -r" to reconnect to see how the process is getting along.  That way you'll always see the last line of any output.</p>
<p>You can also try redirecting output, or using typescript, but osm2pgsql is quite verbose.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks for the ideas. I tried redirecting the output to a file initially but as you said, it is quite verbose and I got worried that just the output would eat up all my disk space.</p>
<p>I'll give "screen+detach" a try. In case you know this off the top and if you will indulge a newb question - will "screen+detach" work even if I log off the machine or do I have to keep the same SSH session alive all through the import? Unfortunately I have to log off once I start the job so I need a way that keeps stuff running even then.</p></div>

<p>yes</p>

<p>If something kills the "SCREEN" process then bad things will happen.  Otherwise you'll see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>me@mymachine:~$ ps -ef | grep 1628
ajtown    1628     1  0 Mar02 ?        00:00:08 SCREEN
ajtown    1629  1628  0 Mar02 pts/1    00:00:00 /bin/bash
ajtown   25162 25135  0 20:04 pts/2    00:00:00 grep --color=auto 1628
</code></pre>
<p>"pts/1" is running something via screen, and has been since March 2nd.  The original session was logged out, but I can reconnect via "screen -r" any time I want.  What I can't guarantee is what happens when your machine completely runs out of memory - my experience is that osm2pgsql would be killed and not "SCREEN", but I can't guarantee that.</p></div>
