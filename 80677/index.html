<p>I want to do a bulk edit on a huge number of small buildings. How can I select multiple buildings to do that?</p>
<p>Clicking them all individually I just tried, spend 10 minutes on it, and then my selection got discarded silently without any warning, and without the possibility to undo that. Fix this please!! I'm quite annoyed by this, frankly.</p>
<p>So how to do this properly?</p>
<p>If I drag a selection around them, it only selects "points", the nodes that make up a building. But not the buildings themselves. There's also no filter. I would ideally first unclutter the editing map to hide features I'm not interested in editing. Then drag a selection around the buildings, and have that select <em>buildings</em>, not the nodes that make up buildings.</p>
<p>Also, searching doesn't really work. I was hoping to search by tag or something and do a bulk action from there, but no.</p>
<p>What is the best way to do this?</p>
<p>/edit
btw I'm trying the iD editor. I also tried JOSM, but my goggly goodness that is a piece of crap. Sorry, but it really is. It lives in 1993 and it's just... Ugh. Nope, I won't be using that anymore. Multiselecting with the iD editor seems the way to go. Shouldn't be that hard either, really.</p>
<p>Specially what I need to do: select ALL buildings dragging a selection around them, then filter that selection by a specific tag (generic building, not house/apartment/whatever). How hard can it be??</p>
<p>/edit2
Even when hiding ALL features except building, the draggy selection tool insists on selection points, and NEVER any buildings. And I just discovered it also only works (incorrectly) when zoomed in. But seriously, how does it manage to select features that I've hidden? And not select other features (that aren't points) that ARE hidden? Why can't it just bloody select buildings?</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>FWIW I've voted the question up since in among the JOSM UI hate there are some valid questions being asked.</p>
<p>The right tool for the job here rather depends on what the job is - if it's "select a few things to make the same changes to each" than iD will work just fine; if it's "perform a complicated overpass query to only select certain objects and then change them" then it's either JOSM or use overpass externally and go into iD once per object (which is probably not the best approach).</p>
<p>Also if you're making "the same sort of change" to lots of things then you'll definitely want to explore using the JOSM validator to list other things worth investigating.  Not all of them will be errors, but they'll all be worth looking at.</p></div>

<li>You move the map by dragging with [RMB]. </li>
<li>Explain how you can't lasso select? </li>
<li>There's a Unselect Node button and hotkey. </li>
<li>In search, you add <code>type:way</code> or <code>-type:node</code> to Select or Add; use <code>type:way</code> in Find In Selection; or use <code>type:node</code> in Remove From Selection.</li>

<p>What you want to do is advanced editing that cannot be done with ID editor. JOSM is the advanced editing tool for OSM. It's neither beautiful nor intuitive, but it is the right program for your task. If you can bring yourself to use JOSM, I'd be happy to help you accomplish this task with it.</p>

<p>I was confused, so I checked - you can make changes to multiple things with iD (and with Potlatch, and with JOSM).  In iD use "shift select" to select more that one item.  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/106889113">https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/106889113</a> is the test change, by the way.</p>
<p>However, it's absolutely true that there are some things that you can do in JOSM that you can't do in iD, and that's by design - with JOSM it's fairly easy for people unfamiliar with what they're doing to accidentally change things they weren't expecting to (examples including "adding a tag to all nodes in a multi-select as well as all ways" and "accidentally dragging everything in a large area somewhere else").</p>

<p>To elaborate: </p>
<ol>
<li>JOSM Vanilla allows seeing and selecting selection history. (This is not "undo" since it's not an actual "edit") </li>
<li>JOSM Vanilla allows searching by tags and other metadata; by various syntax (viz RegEx and MapCSS additionally); to include, exlude, or find within selected objects. </li>
<li>JOSM Vanilla has a lasso select tool.</li>
<li>JOSM's Utilsplugin2 has a Select All Inside tool for areas. (And, Unselect Nodes) </li>
<li>iD has such loading behavior when zooming far away. This is an inherent limitation. To compare, JOSM further has a Continous Download plugin (and Download Along); on top of downloading data or opening files, including loading from Overpass Turbo query. </li>
<li>JOSM has a powerful filter working the same as the search function, to hide different objects. (Using a <code>-type:node</code> hide filter will allow you to see, select, and edit only lines in the main interface)</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: Yes, JOSM is the solution. No, it's not "goggly goodness that is a piece of crap. Sorry, but it really is. It lives in 1993 and it's just... Ugh.". If you don't want to use it, it's your choice. Don't blame, let alone shit on anyone. "Multiselecting with the iD editor seems the way to go." is ultimately untrue, for all the design and use concerns here. </p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I'm not balming anyone personally. I don't even know who made it. If I conclude a program is crap, I am free to let people know, thank you very much.</p>
<p>So the question remains: how to I easily multiselect a whole bunch of features, without my selection going POOF at some arbitrary point, and having that selection tool actually selecting what I'm seeing on the map, not what is hidden?</p>
<p>The answer is: JOSM can't do that. No, it just bloody can't. I can't make a selection by dragging. You may claim it can, but it's kjust not possible in practice. iD also can't do it. What remains is a LOT of work for me, and frankly I will not be doing that.</p>
<p>I'm willing to if I can just bloody select things properly. Isn't that supposed to be one of the most basic features of map editing?!</p></div>

If you are so concerned, you need to make a <code>type:node</code> hide filter to hide all points. Then you can select only lines directly. </p>
<p>A possible reason for not implementing a direct action yet is it could match at least my workflow better. I'm not going to toggle filters, or press more buttons when selecting every time. If I want to do it simple, I use Unselect Nodes. If I need it complex, I use Search. You can definitely check and comment on any open tickets for adding functions in JOSM. </p>
<p>Do you get how explaining clearly or checking yourself can help solve an issue now? Much more useful than unloading a bunch of "crap" upfront.</p></div>

For example "JOSM Vanilla allows seeing and selecting selection history" doesn't really explain to someone how to do that.  A web search for "josm selection history" finds a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Basic_editing">couple</a> <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Advanced_editing">of</a> pages, but doesn't find the <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Help">JOSM help</a> at all.  I've never found searching <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/search?q=selection+history">within</a> the JOSM help especially useful.</p>
<p>In terms of what exists now, <a href="https://learnosm.org/en/josm/start-josm/">Learnosm's pages</a> are a good a place to start as any.</p></div>
