<p>This may not be the greatest question format for a help site like this, so...pointers to better ways to ask or get this sort of help would be appreciated as well.</p>
<p>I've been working through a lot of keepright marks in my city (Louisville, KY) and in the process learned about turn restrictions and other sorts of relations.</p>
<p>I know relations can be a bit complex, so before I go crazy doing a bunch of these in the area I'd like to have someone check my work to make sure I'm doing them right.</p>
<p>I did turn restrictions on an interchange in suburban Louisville and was hoping someone well versed in the ways of relations and restrictions could double-check what I did to make sure its correct.</p>
<p>The interchange of Billtown Road and I-265 (Gene Snyder Freeway) is the work I did:

<div class="comment-text"><p>"better ways to ask": see <a href="/faq/">FAQ</a>. I would suggest to use the forum. Mailing list is also an option.  <s>You could delete the question here and ask over there (if there is not an answer here in the meantime).</s>  However, such questions like yours are not seldom here. I think other ways are better suited, other people here seem to be more happy with such questions here.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Personally, I'd say here was a perfectly good place to ask.  Almost no-one in the English speaking world uses the forum, and mailing lists are not for everyone.  That said, any replies would have to be generalised ("in general it's better to do X rather than Y"), but that should be no problem to the people providing answers.</p></div>

Looking here :- <a href="http://map.comlu.com/?zoom=16&amp;lat=38.14669&amp;lon=-85.54363&amp;layer=Mapquest%20Open&amp;overlays=TTT">http://map.comlu.com/?zoom=16&amp;lat=38.14669&amp;lon=-85.54363&amp;layer=Mapquest%20Open&amp;overlays=TTT</a>
your turn restrictions at the junction seem OK.
Regards</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>meta <a href="/users/387/someoneelse"></a><a href="/users/387/someoneelse">@SomeoneElse</a>: well, change it (re. forum use). ;-)   I think such questions are not suited for a collection of frequently asked questions which should be useful for users in the future. In fact such questions like this one add clutter (not that much due to tags) which makes the useful (the one which are also useful to other people) questions harder to find. If someone else has a "Can someone check my work" question the only option would be to look through all such questions to, by chance, find a similar check question.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Continuing the meta discussion <a href="/users/5179/aseerel4c26">@aseerel4c26</a>
It might be nice to have this kind of capability available for (and advertised to) new users. For example, check a box to have someone give feedback and it creates a new note? </p>
<p>I don't use the forum so I don't know if that's the best place or not. </p>
<p>I can do this in reverse for my area through a bounding box RSS feed where I can view edits, and also get notice of new (or newish) mappers.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>meta <a href="/users/595/neuhausr">@neuhausr</a>: yes, I agree. I also remember that we somewhere here on this site (in similar questions) had a meta discussion about this topic (request for check/feedback). Do not know where, currently.  I would not mix it with the notes system as the people responding to "please check my work" requests may be quite a different group (and might also be non-local mappers).</p>
<p>RSS feeds: yes, sure, they are useful, but work the other way round, as you note.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>I think what <a href="/users/3443/hendrikklaas">@Hendrikklaas</a> is trying to say is that the map that is displayed within your profile page (if you have chosen a home location) shows other mappers who have also chosen a home location that is near you.  It doesn't necessarily show people who have mapped locally and it doesn't necessarily show current mappers.  I'm not sure where P2 (Potlatch 2, the old default editor on the site) fits in though.</p>
<p>If you want to look for nearby mappers, some of <a href="http://neis-one.org/">Pascal Neis' tools</a> might work better, such as <a href="http://resultmaps.neis-one.org/oooc?zoom=12&amp;lat=38.1465&amp;lon=-85.5458&amp;layers=B00TFFFFFT">this one</a> shows mappers near where you linked to above, colour coded according to activity.  From each of those pins you can get other information such as a heat map of activity.  It doesn't filter "people who mapped things years ago but don't an more" though.</p>
<p>Also (just in case you're not aware) note that at the bottom right of an iD shows how else is the last editor of the things in your current editing window.</p></div>
