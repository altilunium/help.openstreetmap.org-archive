<p>Let me attempt this again.  Little Rock might have had US 70B.  I got on Google Maps yesterday and followed the partially new route for US 70 through Little Rock and North Little Rock.  I attempt to change the eastbound route to what is today.  That changed.  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=14/34.7222/-92.3199.">https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=14/34.7222/-92.3199.</a> is from OSM.
Searching in edit for US 70 will produce this.
Road Route US 70 (Little Rock, AR).  I corrected the names to be US 70 instead of US 70B.  The route changed within the last 3 years.  I did not create this the first time.  Clicking Arkansas here takes you to the Arkansas portion of US 70.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_70#Arkansas.">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_70#Arkansas.</a> I tried to select mile marker 128 on I 30 since that is the last one before the interchange heading eastbound.  I 30 also does not go east and west and also crosses the Arkansas River before ending at I 40.  Little Rock has Broadway Street.  North Little Rock has West &amp; East Broadway Street and Broadway Street.  The Broadway Bridge connects each Broadway Street from Little Rock to North Little Rock.
I think I 30 needs the US 70 designation removed but am unsure.  Let me get to my issue.  If I could do this eastbound, I would create the other route.  My route appears to begin in NLR on West Broadway Street before going over The Broadway Bridge to complete part of the route.  I labeled each section where this should be US 70 for the road number that was not already labeled as such.  What do I need to do to cause this to begin where I wish and follow the route I wish?  I know that was wordy.</p>
