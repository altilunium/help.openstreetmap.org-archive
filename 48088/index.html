<p>There are two nearby state forests, "A" and "B". When I use Query Features in OSM, and select a feature like a road or path inside "A", the sidebar includes the state forest "A" as an Enclosing Feature. But when I do the same thing with a feature inside "B", it does not list "B" as an enclosing feature.</p>
<p>I would like to fix "B", so I looked closer at the features and tags.</p>
<p>Both "A" and "B" are closed ways, with landuse=forest and a name. But "A" is the outer-role member of a multipolygon relation, and B is not a member of a relation. That is the only difference. So it seems to me that being a member of a multipolygon relation makes the way a candidate for being an enclosing feature.</p>
<p>Other features I see listed under Enclosing Features are administrative boundaries (with or without multipolygons), so it seems that type=boundary and/or boundary=administrative also makes a closed way appear as an enclosing feature.</p>
<p>Am I right about this? Is there documentation on what causes a closed Way to be listed as an enclosing feature? (I couldn't find anything on the OSM wiki.)</p>

<p>The enclosing features are area features coming from <a href="http://overpass-api.de/">http://overpass-api.de/</a> .</p>
<p>There is some discussion here:</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Areas">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Areas</a></p>
<p>I think a landuse=forest should create an area, but maybe it hasn't been generated yet. I used the script below to find out that areas were last generated 2 days ago. Is the feature newer than that?</p>
<p>This is about the simplest script that will return an area:</p>
<p><a href="http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/eo7">http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/eo7</a></p>
<p>The timestamp is returned in the output, Overpass Turbo does the math and displays it if you hover over the statistics on the lower right.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>According to the script that generates the areas (<a href="https://github.com/drolbr/Overpass-API/blob/master/rules/areas.osm3s">areas.osm3s</a>) multipolygon relations are only considered if they have a <em>name</em> tag. This name tag requirement also applies to some other objects (e.g. relations tagged with <em>admin_level</em> or <em>boundary</em>, various ways with certain tags) but not all of them (e.g. relations with <em>postal_code</em> or <em>addr:postcode</em> tag). But that doesn't mean that people should start adding <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Names#Name_is_the_name_only">wrong name tags</a>.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Thanks for the info. The link lead me to this textual description of what makes a way into a polygon (area):
<a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_turbo/Polygon_Features">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_turbo/Polygon_Features</a></p>
<p>According to that, landuse=forest on a closed loop way without area=no makes a polygon.  But I know that isn't working as far as "enclosing features" goes. I also looked at the area3.osm3s script. With my very limited understanding of it, I see it does use landuse (other than no), with name, and not area=no to make a polygon. I also see the script considers a multipolygon to be a polygon but only if it has a name, and the one ("A" above) does not, yet it does work as an enclosing feature.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to fix my case "B" above - to make it like "A" and see what happens. As much as I would like to understand what is happening, I'm OK with fixing the feature and moving on.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>This is very strange, and I obviously don't know what is going on. But after looking at it some more, the problem isn't that the State Forests don't show as Enclosing Features. The problem is that <em>nothing</em> shows as enclosing features. This is happening for large areas of Southern New Jersey, such as here: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/39.6176/-74.5007">http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/39.6176/-74.5007</a></p>
<p>When I use Query Features on a road there, I see no Enclosing Features at all. But further south, I see at least a County, State, and Country as Enclosing Features.</p>
<p>Something seems to be blocking it from working there. I thought maybe it was the Pinelands National Reserve area ( <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/33832747">http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/33832747</a> ) which is a huge closed way that surrounds this (tags: area=yes, boundary=national_park) but that doesn't seem to be the cause. Enclosing Features works in some places inside this area.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>A script like this, with the coordinates copied from a failed query:</p>
<pre><code>is_in(39.6883,-74.4133);
out;
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="http://overpass-turbo.eu/s/eqa">try it here</a>)</p>
<p>Succeeds, so the problem does not seem to be the existence of the areas on the Overpass API server.</p>
<p>Firefox reports an error on the blank results <code>TypeError: e.bounds is undefined</code>, and not on successful results. So the issue is probably in the JS code powering the query feature. Not sure where to begin debugging that, maybe in <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/index/query.js">https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/index/query.js</a></p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>maxerickson: I think you have figured it out. The areas are OK, but the problem is with the browser and the query. I am seeing almost the same thing: "Error: TypeError: t.bounds is undefined", "Source File: <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/assets/...">http://www.openstreetmap.org/assets/..."</a> in my browser. (Using either Firefox or Seamonkey browsers.)</p>
<p>But I suppose it still could be something in the map data that triggers this, which would explain why it only happens in some areas.</p></div>
