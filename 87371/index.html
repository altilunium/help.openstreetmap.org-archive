<p>If what is usually a sidewalk has shared cycling access along a roadway and is named or unnamed, should that be tagged as a Sidewalk or Cycle &amp; Foot Path?  Obviously, exclude the paths and trails that are not along roadways.  I have changed some sidewalks with shared access to Cycle &amp; Foot Paths in the greater Denver area.  I do not live there but will visit this month.  I checked my email on a new computer and received a one asking why I changed the type of some sidewalks to designated Cycle &amp; Foot Paths.  Each already had cycling and foot access listed.  I did not guess with the assumption what was there was correct.  Should those be tagged as Sidewalks or Cycle &amp; Foot Paths when a sidewalk can fit the criteria with the cycling exception?  Some of the paths that I changed to Cycle &amp; Foot Paths could also be considered Bridle Paths.   Most of those were not along roadways.  I left the Bridle Paths alone since those are new to me.  Some (foot) paths and cycling paths (not labeled together) had designated access to each type including motorized.  Might I receive feedback please?  I do not have any specific examples.  I worked on 2 bus routes as I edited the other.  I worked on bus routes 99 and 100 along Kipling Street but think I recall that along parts of S Kipling Pkwy or St.</p>

<p>I suppose this might be related to this change you made here
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/137339657">https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/137339657</a></p>
<p>The sidewalk was mapped as "highway=path" + "foot=yes" + "bicycle=yes".</p>
<p>You clicked on an upgrade suggestion offered by the iD editor.  This is one of the problems with iD and its "presets", which changed tags into this: "highway=cycleway" + "foot=designated" + "bicycle=designated".</p>
<p>AFAIK, routing will work identically in both situations.  In the first situation (before your change) the sidewalk was labelled as a generic path open to both pedestrians and cyclists, and now (after your change) it is primarily defined as a cycle path that allows pedestrians too.  This is probably why the reason why another mapper asked why you did this.</p>

<p>Some part of the confusion may come from this: Vocabulary such as "Sidewalk or Cycle &amp; Foot Path" only exists within the iD editor.</p>
<p>The iD editor is just <em>one</em> of the available editors for OSM.  The universal way to talk about objects in OSM is by inspecting the real tags that go to the database, e.g. "highway=cycleway".</p>
