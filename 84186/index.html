<p>Hi all, I'm trying to improve the address tagging for <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1050323409">this apartment complex</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the facts on the ground:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole complex has one house number, 23411 Summerfield.</li>
<li>Within the complex there are around 50 buildings, each with its own building number, e.g., Building 12</li>
<li>Apartments' postal addresses are based on a building number and unit letter. So an example address would be 24311 Summerfield Apt. 42B.</li>
<li>Mail to the building management office is just addressed to 23411 Summerfield, with no unit number.</li>
<li>In most buildings, each unit has its own building entrance.</li>
<li>Many units have both a pedestrian entrance and a garage entrance. Some units have an assigned garage in a separate building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently we have ways for the complex as a whole and for each building, and I expect we'll want to add entrance nodes for apartments with private entrances. Also there are currently address tags on the buildings but they were imported and I claim they're incorrect.</p>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What address tags, if any, should be populated on the landuse=resedential node linked above?</li>
<li>What address tags, if any, should be populated on the individual buildings? Note that with the exception of the management office, no building corresponds to a single postal delivery point.</li>
<li>What address tags, if any, should be populated on pedestrian apartment entrances?</li>
<li>What address tags, if any, should be populated on garage apartment entrances?</li>
</ul>

<p>The addr:* scheme of OSM is technically only directed at postal addresses, so applying this principle rigorously reduces the problem: neither the buildings themselves, nor the garages have postal addresses. 
So from an addressing perspective, I would ignore these two aspects right now (how to tag the house number on a separately located garage is an intricate question in itself). I see no reason why you cannot tag the buildings with a name tag, or alternatively a ref tag (depending on how they are marked on the ground).</p>
<p>For the standard apartment units I'd use addr:flats or addr:unit (usage differs between US &amp; Europe where unit tends to be used for business premises) together with the street address, and map these to the doors (pedestrian entrances).</p>
<p>The management office can then have the standard street address.</p>
<p>You will notice that this does not solve the complete problem, but as I don't believe these have been solved for OSM as a whole, it's rather easier than trying to create a new scheme.</p>
