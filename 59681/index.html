<p>How to setup my account with OpenID, it always fails.
I have two email addresses but apparently they were mixed on this help, where I'm logged in with my Google+ account.
But it's impossible to setup the OpenID for Google, and there's a mix now with my account on OSM which is not based on Google account.
Why is'nt there a "GoogleConnect" to correctly setup and secure the login ? The old method based on OpenID2 is no longer working without the OAuth2 method.
So I can no longner login correctly here without requesting each tim a new temporary access token by email.
Basic OpenID is no logner working with Google which requires stronger methods (buyt which is still conforming with the OpenID standard, that this help site supports only with an outdated specification).
As well I can no connect using a Blogger account (same reason): there are missing tokens that this help site does not record properly.</p>
<p>Could you add GoogleConnect as a method (and then drop your "Blogger" method that is no longer working at all)?</p>

<p>This is not a question, in general you should open a feature request, if no applicable one already exists, on the website issue tracker <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues">https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues</a> for technical issues.</p>
<p>Note that while google hasn't supported OpenId ("OpenID connect" is something else) for a longish time, you should be able to login with your google account via the "google sign-in" mechanism.</p>

<div class="comment-text"><p>You can't so we have lost once again the possibility to connect here. And many users will not be able too. Google "Connet Now" is conforming to the OpenID standard (this has been asserted), but this site is not. Using OAuth and the enhanced protocol is the way to go: it offers much better security and privacy, and has support for double authentication. Most popular sites have adopted it, but not this one.
So you have lost many OSM users  that can no longer connect here. If you think this is not a problem, and you think this request is "silly" you're alone... OSM needs to be more open and not loose users</p></div>
