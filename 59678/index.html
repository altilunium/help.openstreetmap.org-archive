<p>when there are edit conflicts in iD the conflict editors does not help solving them:
 - it proposes to download our changes, but the link provided goes to a blank page.
 - trying to select any propposed edit from the change fails, iD does not properly download all the needed changes. Then continuing will fail because iD still wants to save objects from their old version iD</p>
<p>In summary, iD is unusable for editing in areas where there are other users cooperating, we just loose ALL our edits for a single object change that we cannot refresh to download them in their current version so that we can then update them as needed.</p>
<p>The conflict editor simply DOES NOT work at all !</p>

The OSM help site isn't really the place for "X doesn't work" statements - it's not a "question" that anyone can answer.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is that you explain the problem with a series of steps to reproduce - if you do that on the dev server <a href="https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/">https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/</a> then you can create any test data that you like.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Hey verdy_p, the issue with the broken "download changes" link is something I just learned about last week.  Turns out that recent versions of Chrome and other browsers no longer like linking to <code>data:</code> urls.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/4346">https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/4346</a></p>
<p>I worked on it over the weekend and was able to fix the issue so that now downloading changes will work again in all supported browsers on the Conflict Resolution screen, as well as the general Upload Changes screen.
<a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/pull/4350">https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/pull/4350</a></p>
<p>I'll probably release a new version of iD in the next few days that includes this fix.  Thanks for your understanding!</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Closed with "negative" comment, but this is a REAL problem.</p>
<p>I've never been able to use the conflict editor in iD, it ALWAYS fails finally when all conflicts are supposed to be solved, by a fatal error where iD contains the wrong old version.</p>
<p>It's even impossible to just discard changes on conflicting objetct and continue with others (there may be plenty of them and loosing everything is definitely not an option when we can simply not even download these changes for external review, for example as an .odm file we could fix by using JOSM instead).</p>
<p>So YES this question is FULLY RELEVANT and ON TOPIC, <a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/387/someoneelse"></a><a href="https://help.openstreetmap.org/users/387/someoneelse">@SomeoneElse</a> you are compeltely wrong ! And it concerns lots of people (not just me).</p>
<p>This is really a severe bug. And it is extremely easy to reproduce, by using  two distinct browsers  connected to different users and user1 making a change to a way currently loaded by User2, then User1 commiting changes on one node, before User2 attempts to commit changes to the same way (such as adding or moving the same node).</p>
<p>Please REOPEN this unsolved bug</p></div>

<p>As SomeoneElse said, this is a Q&amp;A site. Someone asks how to do something, and others give answers to help do that thing. What exactly is your question? If you don't have one, then the best place to post your comments about this issue with iD is in GitHub.</p></div>

<div class="comment-text"><p>Yes of course I read it. You just refuse to admit this is a bug, but many users complain about this. The bug is not solved currently. You refused the bug but bhousel saw it as a real bug on which he is working. Don't be surprised that people stop working on HOT projects when most of them use iD, and if they have passed long time draxing things and thne connecting their ways, to surrounding tile, and loose everything because they can't pass through the edit conflict, they will stop contributing because of their lost patient editing time.</p></div>
